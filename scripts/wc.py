I met with Dr. Landman on the afternoon of the 14th. There are many gifts from Chinese in his office. He introduced the 7 divisions of the lab, promised to help me register for a CS-3860 class, and described what I should do if I take for credit (final report, etc.). He said that the priority of undergraduates is one study, two life, and three research, while graduate students are the other way around. The teacher said that I hope I can learn something from this study, even if I only learn to use ACCRE, even if I learn that I am not suitable for PhD.
If I get accepted to graduate school at the end (of course this is unlikely), I can work here for another year before applying for a PhD. I haven't graduated early with my teacher for the time being. I hope I can stay here for another two months during the summer vacation.
After that, classmate ljj asked me to borrow the algorithm textbook, and I talked with her for half an hour by the way. Like 495, she went to GHC last year and then got the Tech Analyst Intern of Xiaomo New York. I also heard about this position for the first time, and I feel it matches me very well. Maybe I can try it in the future! She said that she was autistic and didn't do much networking before, and I rarely saw her. Hey, 698 is still awesome.
I ran into 359 during dinner. He recently had a breakdown in finding a job. I said that he is a very business person and is it more suitable for consulting. He only wanted to find CS, and said that he actually wanted to be a high school teacher …He showed me the fee of a certain research agency. The top 10 application fee is 28w, which is really nonsense.
On the evening of the 14th, I talked with my dad about the career path and development space of finance for a long time, and told him that I might be able to make a fuss in the field of stock exchange automation. I said that I like the elite atmosphere in the financial field, and the direct impact of finance on society is also greater.
Now, my growth curve in CS is getting more and more flat, and I even feel a little bit entering the "job burnout period". Not only me, but 359 and 495 feel that they can't listen to the class anymore. 495 said that she really wants to give 4269 to P/F. I feel the same way, and it feels uncomfortable to do everything under the pressure of schoolwork.
I had an interview with 590 at noon on the 15th. I checked her LinkedIn before. This person's resume is really rich...Like 698, she recounted her growth trajectory and various experiences very smoothly. She was born in the High School Attached to the National People’s University (she was in science class 2 and 982 in science class 1...). She did an internship at Xiehe Hospital in high school. After that, she applied to major in biology/medicine at the university, and then began to explore career paths under the influence of a liberal arts sister. Determined to transfer before entering university.
In the summer vacation of senior high school, she first did a meeting audit at Lixin, but dealing with stacks of documents was really daunting. Immediately after internship in Deloitte, she ran many groups: she said that when going to a place, she should make good use of the resources there. She made coffee chats with people from various departments, and finally accumulated a wide range of contacts in Deloitte. Bring the new interns to eat with her.
590 Said that he is a person with a strong liberal arts and a weak science, and he is better at interpersonal communication, but he is still studying mathematics. She said that she didn't like small talk and liked in-depth conversations; for example, when she was in Deloitte, the people there were elites, and it was easy and effortless to communicate with them, so the experience was very good. This resonated deeply with me.
590 explains the difference between private equity and hedging: primary market vs. secondary market, trade secrets vs. public information... She said hedging is more mathematical because it analyzes the stock market; private equity requires a stronger sense of business, because startups don’t Quantifiable information. Professionalism and industry knowledge are also very important: she was researching a company engaged in optics at the time, and then went to Fudan Library to borrow a lot of physics books (a bit like consulting ers' daily work).
It also analyzed the experience difference between the seller (investment bank) and the buyer (fund management): investment banks are professional performers and work in a step-by-step manner; PE requires strong dialectical thinking, and will debate and quarrel with colleagues: what industry to invest in, which one to invest in Company? A lot can be learned from these.
At 12:40, I had to interrupt her and started to introduce myself: I studied CS under the influence of Nanwai's environment before, but recently I found that there are more and more friends studying finance around me. I asked her which field of finance my math + statistics + programming background is suitable for. She mentioned financial technology, which coincides with what my dad said. Ok…
On the night of the 15th, I chatted with 565 in Kissam for a while. He recorded Deloitte’s technology consulting as an internship in DC. He has almost never prepared a case. The first interview question is how to detect drugs from inbound packages. Of course, the focus of this interview is how to "propose and solve" and how to solve the problem. The second question is whether a company should upload a database to the cloud. He can really analyze the pros and cons from various angles, and it has been a while. But these are relatively fictitious things. Consultation is just to give advice, not practical.
I used the knowledge I learned in the last three weeks to discuss with him his future plans: studying for an MBA, jumping to a technology company to do management, and even studying for a PhD. Born in Hangzhou in 565, he almost went to Qingbei as an international student, but it is better to be in the United States. Vandy's FA and government scholarship together can cover most of his tuition and fees. Although he is a U.S. citizen, he is still very concerned about the country. Knowing WST, he even considered returning to China for development...?
On the evening of the 19th, I ran into 565 again at cms. It turned out that he hadn't formally signed Deloitte. Now Linen also gave him the offer of SWE, which is closer to his home and the hourly salary is at least $10. He is still struggling-writing codes It's easy to transfer consultation, but it's difficult to reverse it.

14号下午我和Dr. Landman会面，他的办公室里有好多中国人送的礼物。他介绍了lab的7个divisions，答应帮我注册一个CS-3860的课，描述了我如果take for credit的话应该做啥（final report等）。他说本科生的priority是一学习，二生活，三研究，研究生则是反过来。老师说希望我能从这段研究中学到东西，哪怕只是学会用ACCRE，哪怕学到了自己不适合读博士。
如果我最后研究生录取跪了（当然这不太可能），我可以在这里再干一年再申PhD。我暂时没和老师提提早毕业的事，希望到时候暑假可以在这里再做两个月吧。
之后ljj同学找我借算法教材，我顺便和她聊了大半个小时。和495一样，她去年去了GHC，然后拿到了小摩纽约的Tech Analyst Intern。我还第一次听说这个职位，感觉和我很match，以后也许可以一试！她说她挺自闭的，之前也没怎么做networking，而我也很少见到她。哎，还是698厉害啊。
晚饭时我遇到了359，他最近找工作找得很崩溃，我说觉得他是个很商科的人，是不是比较适合搞咨询，他则只想找CS，还说他其实最想做高中老师…他给我看了某申研中介的费用，top10的申请费是28w，真是太扯淡了。
14号晚上我和老爸聊了很久金融的职业道路和发展空间问题，和他讲我也许能在证券交易自动化这一领域做文章。我说我喜欢金融领域的精英氛围，金融对社会的直接影响也更大。
现在我在CS的成长曲线越来越平缓，甚至有点进入“职业倦怠期”的感觉。不仅是我，359、495都感觉已经听不太进去课了，495说她真想把4269给P/F了，我感同身受，被课业压着做啥都难受。
15号中午和590约谈，之前翻了一遍她的领英，此人履历真是贼丰富…和698一样，她极其流畅地讲述了一遍自己的成长轨迹和各种经历。她是人大附中出身（她在理科2班，982在理科1班…），高中在协和医院做了实习，之后大学申请主攻生物/医学，然后在一位文科学姐影响下开始探索职业道路，没进大学便决心转学。
高三暑假她先是在立信做了会审计，但是和一摞摞文件打交道实在令人头大。紧接着又在德勤实习，跑了很多组：她说去一个地方就要利用好那里的资源，她约了各个部门的人coffee chat，最后在德勤积累了广泛的人脉，每年回去大佬们都会带上新的实习生们和她吃饭。
590说自己是个文强理弱的人，更善于人际交往，不过现在还是在学数学。她说自己不爱闲聊，喜欢有深度的对话；比如她在德勤时，那里的人都是精英，和他们交流方便不费力，所以体验很好。这引起了我很深的共鸣。
590解释了私募和对冲的区别：一级市场vs二级市场，商业机密vs公开信息…她说对冲更偏数学，因为要分析股市；私募则要有更强的商业嗅觉，因为创业公司没有可量化的信息。专业性和行业知识也很重要：她当时研究一个搞光学相关的公司，然后去复旦图书馆借了好多物理书看（有点咨询ers日常工作的味道啊）。
还分析了卖方（投行）和买方（基金管理）的体验区别：投行是专业的执行者，工作按部就班；PE则要很强的辩证思维，会和同事辩论、吵架：投什么产业，投哪家公司？从这些都能学到很多。
到12:40，我才不得不打断她，开始介绍自己的情况：之前受南外的环境影响学了CS，最近却发现身边越来越多学金融的朋友。我问她我的数学+统计+编程背景适合金融的哪个领域，她提到金融科技，这和老爸说的不谋而合。嗯…
15号晚上我在Kissam和565聊了一会人生，他实习录了德勤的科技咨询，地点是DC。他都几乎没准备过case，第一个面试问题是如何从入境包裹中检测毒品，当然这个的侧重点是怎么“提建议解决”、解决的流程如何。第二个问题是一个公司该不该上传数据库到云端，他还真能从各个角度分析利弊，扯上好一阵子。不过这些都是比较虚的东西，咨询就是给建议嘛，不实操的。
我用最近三周学到的知识，和他探讨了他的未来规划：读MBA，跳到科技公司做管理，甚至读博士。565生于杭州，差点以国际生身份去了清北，但综合考虑还是在米国好，Vandy的FA和政府scholarship加起来能覆盖他大部分学杂费。虽然他是美国公民，但对国内还是挺关注的，知道WST，甚至考虑过回国发展…？
19号晚上又在cms偶遇了565，原来他还没正式签约德勤，现在亚麻也给了他SWE的offer，离他家更近而且时薪高至少10刀，他还在纠结——写码转咨询容易，反过来难。
