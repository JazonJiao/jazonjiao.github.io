### The disillusionment

This excerpt from D5P248 pointed out how I came into the lab with
ambition to build smart cities, but was disillusioned by how trivial my job was:
```
I had been interested in applying ML techniques to build smarter cities 
and transportation systems. However, after experiencing what research really is like, 
I find that sometimes, technologies described in sci-fi movies or documentaries aren’t 
being developed at all. My ambition before entering Prof. Work’s lab was gradually 
disillusioned as I worked on things that have little to do with my envisions of better 
transportation systems, i.e. AoT nodes.
```

### Role in my career path

Up until grad school application, the Work Lab RAship was almost the only
research or internship experience I had, and thus, it was crucial
for my application—the 250 hours I spent in the lab possibly
outweighed the 5,000 hours I spent on coursework during college life. 
In October 2019, as I wrote my Statement of Purpose for grad school,
I had to go back and "scrutinize every single detail of what I did" 
in the lab (D5P251).

Luckily, my advisor, Prof. Dan Work, gave me a great deal of support for
my applications, even though most of what I did in the lab was pretty basic 
data analysis work. To this day I'm very grateful for that.

When I applied to internships in 2020 Spring, this was still one of 
the only projects I could refer to, whenever I'm asked about my past experiences.

In all, it's not an understatement to say this internship opened the door 
for my career development.
