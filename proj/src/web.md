## Technical Summary

This website uses Bootstrap 5.0 for responsiveness and styling.
As of July 2021, no JavaScript or node_modules are involved in this project.

I define my own Markdown Language syntax for my Diaries and Blogs, respectively,
so that they can support custom functionality. I have Python scripts
that I run locally to generate HTML files from those markdown files.

The GitHub repo for the website is currently private.
