    <h3 class="py-1 border-bottom">Introduction</h3>
    <p class="mt-3">
      In the computer, a road network is represented by a graph,
      i.e. a series of <span style="color: forestgreen">nodes</span> and <span style="color: darkorange">edges</span>.
    </p><p>
      <span style="color: forestgreen">Nodes</span> represent <span style="color: forestgreen">road intersections</span>,
      and have properties like (latitude, longitude) coordinates, whether a traffic light is present, etc.
    </p><p>
      <span style="color: darkorange">Edges</span> represent <span style="color: darkorange">roads</span>,
      and have properties like number of lanes, which nodes it connects to, etc.
    </p>

  <div class="mb-5">
    <h3 class="py-1 border-bottom">Task</h3>
    <p class="mt-3">
      I needed to find how Tencent's road network was different
      with respect to NavInfo's road network. In other words,
      find what are <strong>missing</strong> and what are <strong>redundant</strong>
      in the Tencent Map database.
    </p><p>
      For example, I needed to find the inaccuracies of traffic light information for
      all nodes (i.e. road intersections) in Tencent Maps.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="mb-5">
    <h3 class="py-1 border-bottom">Action</h3>
    <p class="mt-3">
      I tried to pair up the nodes from the two networks, based on their coordinates.
      When two nodes are paired up, I look at whether one of them is marked
      <code>"traffic_light: true"</code>
      whereas the other is not.
    </p><p>
      I used multiprocessing to scale up the matching program to run the national road network.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="mb-5">
    <h3 class="py-1 border-bottom">Result</h3>
    <p class="mt-3">
      My program outputted more than 30,000 differences in traffic light data from the
      two road networks. Using similar methods, I found 70+ differences in toll gates.
    </p><p>
      I analyzed and categorized the cases, and presented my findings to the team.
      For example, some differences are due to recent changes in the road network;
      some are because the area is too remote.
    </p><p>
      The results are sent to the mapping team to verify and fix.
    </p>

      This internship was part of the selective "pre-Study Abroad" program of Tencent,
      where the interns consists of college graduates heading to grad school
      after the summer.
    </p><p>
      Due to COVID-19 pandemic, my internship was done remotely as I stayed in
      Nashville, while my team is based in Beijing. My leader cared about my
      health and I had flexible work hours, apart from needing to attend a weekly meeting
      at mid-night (U.S. central time).
    </p><p>
      My first project was finding missing pedestrian paths (in parks, schools, etc.)
      using datasets such as anonymous GPS data.
      However, I wasn't able to make much progress 2 weeks into the project,
      mainly due to a lack of mentorship, communication difficulties,
      and the intricacy of the code base.
    </p><p>
      In the 3rd week, my leader assigned me the "Road Network Matching" task,
      which turned out much more doable.
    </p><p>
      The internship experience greatly helped me understand what it's like
      to work at a Chinese tech company, as well as connect
      with the programmer community in China.
