14`The finals week for '18 Fall was so intense, my mind so nervous, that it has cast a shadow on my mind. Despite this, throughout the winter break, I forced a lot of motivation on myself because of 493, to the point that I was still mentally collapsing sometimes. I thought a ton about the 12/12 and the 5/0, about how similar my experiences with 457 and 493 are.
41`I sent 493 a happy new year on 1/1 and she replied, but half an hour later, she sent me another pretty long message about the letter I sent her on 12/17. I didn’t expect she would actually reply, so it was kind of a surprise.
41`The message was mostly encouraging me for my hard work, in the midst of which there’s an inconspicuous but firm rejection. So basically my 2019 started with a rejection from someone I’ve had a crush on for 14 months (now 15)…
42`If the intensity of my feelings after the 5/0 Incident was 100—I literally took several months to recover from it—then it’s only a single-digit number after 493’s rejection. I didn’t feel too bad, partly because she offered so much encouragement, and partly because I’ve got tons of tasks to keep me occupied and confident.
43`At the moment I was also a bit relieved that I could try out someone else, like 671 (I’m sorry…). The chocolate I bought in Japan was supposedly for 671. Well, two weeks into the semester, but I still couldn’t get enough feelings for that, so I guess I’ll probably still be single—maybe all the way to graduation in 2020. That isn’t a bad thing, though.
14`In retrospect, 493’s message almost completely changed my mindset and lifestyle in the first three to four weeks of January.
14`18 days into 2019, and 493’s words really have had an intense encouraging effect on me. Now, under the powerful influence of 3b1b, I’ve been very inclined to learn Math, but not so much for coding questions. (Yes, I know 18 days have passed since she sent that reply. I just literally didn’t have time to record my feelings until now.)
12`I coded on LeetCode on the first day of winter break, and only on that day. After that, all of my extra time is spent studying linear algebra. I can’t have sustained focus when studying data structures, and solving coding problems has not yet become part of my life like math does. That’s when motivation is very necessary.
42`These days, I still spend a lot of time thinking of her, thinking about surpassing her—so much so that sometimes I feel like, whenever the idea of 493 crosses my mind, I would feel an impetus for working harder to catch up on her. Which is kinda what I want.
42`Well, I also thought a ton about 493 last semester, but back then, more often than not, it only increased my stress and severely damaged my health condition. I think that’s because I didn’t know of her conditions then, and actually had a lot of doubt about her real ability; her attitudes towards me was also quite bad; and I was already under intense work load at the time…
14`On 1/17 I registered for the annual premium membership on LeetCode, and the plan is to solve 1,000 problems by the application season… I doubt whether I’ll actually achieve this, but at least last year, many of my academic goals were overfulfilled. I’ll continue to set 493 as my goal!
14`The thing I love about math is I don’t have to deal with annoying hardware stuff that I have absolutely no idea what’s going on (the homework for the OS and the Graphics course I am taking).
43`On 1/27, 619 told me that of the 6 girls in NFLS 2022ers, 4 are single. My first reaction was: “Also, keines von ihnen studiert Naturwissenschaften...” I thanked her but somewhat despised her for always talking about these issues.
42`By 1/28 (and 4/5), no one at school ever mentioned 493 and the fact that she got into Facebook on any occasion, which is really weird. Had I not encountered her on 12/17, it’s hard to say what I would be thinking right now.
