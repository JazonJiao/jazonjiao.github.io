13`By now I still can’t have super sustained focus when reading data structures and algorithms. That’s when motivation is necessary. Now it’s really hard to transition from math to coding, under the powerful influence of 3b1b. This inability to concentrate reminds me of how important 3b1b’s videos are. Now I can immerse myself in learning linear algebra for hours, and that’s largely due to his videos.
11`On 1/9 I decided to enroll in a Deutsch class and dropped the ethics class. This is the first time I’ve ever been to Furman Hall, and the class turned out pretty exciting (although the textbook is ridiculously expensive). Learning a Second Foreign Language is quite a different experience from all the CS and Linear Algebra stuff that I’m used to, and it can help fulfill my “15% goal!” (The ratio of time spent learning humanities VS STEM must be at least 1 : 5)
11`Another class has passed, and my impression on the German class is super good. The professor is nice, the class is fun, and the homework—although there’s a lot of them—is actually a good relax from other math/CS courses. Learning a new language is not only super practical (based on my experience in Japan a week ago), but can also help me reinforce some everyday English expressions, which I’m still not super proficient at.
11`I got into the waitlist of CS-3270 on 1/11 night, but I don’t think I will take it, since that would mean taking a total of 18 hours. On 1/11 24:00, all waitlists are emptied. Subsequently, on 1/12, an empty spot appeared in CS-3250, so I dropped Math-3620 to enroll in it! Oh yes!! How amazing…
24`On 1/15 afternoon I also held my first office hour this semester, and I met 462 there. I asked her about her course selection (CS-4260 is a bad course), what language she used in interviews (Python), whether non-technical, behavioral questions were asked (no), what she put on the resume, etc. She happily asks me to update her with how I end up.
22`On 1/16 I learned from 495 that I can check employer information on DoreWays; on 1/17 I registered for an Amazon event on 1/29 and learned that they’ll be here during the winter career fair. I also learned from Gwen that there’s a Google Summer of Code thing…
11`On 1/16 afternoon in the middle of our Algorithms class, Jeremy received a phone call about her wife stopping breathing, and he dismissed the class. He cautioned us on the first day of class that his wife has a fatal disease and so he has to keep his phone on in case of an emergency. He later canceled class on Friday since his wife passed away. R.I.P.!! Well, at least I could eat lunch earlier on Friday (I have to have lunch at 14:00 on MWF since I have class from 11:00 to 14:00)…
34`In fact, I have decided to first get some porridge at 8 and then at 9:30 get some breakfast at Kissam on WMF so that I don’t get hungry until 14:00. When I eat food from munchie, my body will still complain fiercely, so I try not to do that.
34`BTW, last Friday-ish I tried out eBronson’s lunch for the first time, and it went pretty well. On 1/16 I ate there again and my stomach was the fullest ever in all of sophomore year at school. By now my physical condition and social life is much better, while the course load is much lower than last semester.
