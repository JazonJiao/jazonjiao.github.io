<h2>Three years to graduation: A Plan (incomplete)</h2>
21`1. A warning to myself: this may not be the best choice
21`I am bound to miss tons of opportunities at school. I will have very limited time to participate in recreational activities like outdoor trips, courses in the Rec center, and performances.
21`2. The benefits of graduating in three years: (incomplete)
21`3. The lost liberal arts Education: To graduate in 3 years, I can only choose a very limited number of liberal arts courses at Vandy. I may take only 2 to 4 more non-engineering/math courses to satisfy the graduation requirements.
14`But do I need to take more liberal arts courses at Vandy? No. Studying liberal arts subjects in the US is rather inefficient since I can understand the books less quickly than if I read Chinese.
14`I don’t actually need to learn social science subjects at college, since I believe that as of now, reading books or articles, or watching YouTube Crash Course in my spare time, is sufficient for my personal development.
14`As of early April, I typically read history for a few hours every week to relax, expand outlook, and regain motivation. I have watched crash course videos on economics, history, literature, and so on. Since I don’t need to worry about tests on what I learn, I can learn for a better attitude.
14`I don’t need to go deep into any subject, just an overview of some important knowledge is enough—for learning liberal arts subjects, breadth is better than depth. In addition, I can continue to teach ACT English.
14`4. An outline of my course choice in the next two years: (incomplete)
