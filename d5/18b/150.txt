31`(incomplete Diary for Xi’an PanoFair)
31`I ate dinner with Amber, Zecheng, and another Stanford girl, and we had a great time talking. At the after party, I played 3 rounds of werewolf.
31`This event is the most pleasant one I’ve ever experienced since the ASB; after it I felt a surge of happiness that offered me a lot of new insights.
24`In 2017, I once wrote that socializing is easy, and I will have lots of friends in the future—so, I’ve been suppressing social activities for most of my freshman year. However, I’ve begun to question whether this is actually worth it.
24`I feel sorry for my new friends since I can’t keep in touch with them through WeChat Moments (since I don’t use it), and I’m afraid that our friendship will soon be lost.
33`When touring the historic sites in Xi’an, my understanding of the advancement of civilizations deepened. Although our ancestors were experienced at governing people and war strategies compared to Westerners, the mindset of the great European mathematicians and scientists have blown my mind when I recently read about them. In the recent centuries, the achievements of Western science is just so great.
