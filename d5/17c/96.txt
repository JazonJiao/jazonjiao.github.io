31`On 11/19 I visited the dorm of 465, 482, and 480 in Lewis, then went to the Rec for the first time in…quite a long time.
12`I took a Python online course and planned to finish Zybooks during the break, but my efficiency was low. I then took another approach: project-oriented learning for CS—learn by creating my own program—which is expected to increase my efficiency dramatically. I also learned some C++ during the break, and checked out the myriad programming websites and resources online.
