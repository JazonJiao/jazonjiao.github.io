34`Recently I’ve been sleeping not as late as before, and getting up earlier. At first I thought that DST is the main reason. But on 11/14 I suddenly realized that my eating lunch and dinner earlier since starting to chase 493 might also have an impact on my natural circadian cycle. Want to sleep early? Eat early!
31`In the two days before T-break, about a fourth of the classes are cancelled, and class attendance has decreased. On 11/17 I used the remaining 4 default flex meals and purchased much food (mainly instant noodles) for T-break. I carried a refrigerator from 329’s dorm to mine (during which an American boy helped me carry it) so that I can store the meat I bought, avoiding a previous situation when I forgot about the meat and eventually it got stink and attracted a lot of terrifying bugs.
