23`Now, my experience of what happened on 11/13 has again deepened my understanding into my family and the nature of love within family members. The lessons I learned from the 11/13 can be applied to education of children and handling my emotions in an obsession.
23`For example, many times, the more you want your children to achieve better, the worse the results. During March 2016, I consistently reminded myself to be more positive and optimistic in daily lives and in front of 457. Ironically, because I was constantly thinking about this, I became increasingly depressed.
Such is the danger of obsession; the more intensely you care about something, the less likely you will handle it correctly because of the emotions. This reminds me of several mothers who are so obsessed with their childrenâ€™s performance that their actions backfired.
23`Added on 171206: By now, the diaries related to or inspired by 493 has exceeded 11,000 words. This experience is continuing to inspire me tremendously about the nature of humanity and emotions, and shape my personality and qualities.
