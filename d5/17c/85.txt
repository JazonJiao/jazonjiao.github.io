31`On 10/12, the first day of the 4-day Fall Break, 120 and 671 invited me and 309 to downtown and we visited TN State Museum and the public library. I learned something new about US history in the museum. (The fact that 120 invited us two kinda illustrates her value for friends, which is similar to mine.)
In general, there’s few interesting things downtown. I later visited the two girls’ dorm; they visited mine the next day, and said that boys’ dorms are much tidier (girls just have too much stuff…).
31`On 10/13 133 and 139 went to Atlanta; at night 876 invited me to dinner and we had a wonderful talk. He talked about his struggles when first arriving in Nashville, and his difficulties in the first 40 days of joining a fraternity (when members are obliged to do many things to show their loyalty and increase bond). I later visited his dorm.
On 10/14 night I and xjj went to the Target store. I bought $75 worth of stuff and he helped zqy retrieve her credit card at a Japanese restaurant. On 10/15 night 545 and 355 invited me and 619 to dumplings.
23`On 10/15 I reviewed some of my previous Ballance masterpieces as well as Ballance tieba. I felt a strong sense of nostalgia and had some new ideas about creativity, programming, and friendship.
Why do I enjoy the support in Ballance bar while failing to do well in social life at school? How can I transfer my unparalleled map-making skills to other areas like programming and Maths? These are questions worth thinking about.
On 10/16 the Visions group visited the Center for Student Wellbeing. On 10/18 we had the CS 4-2 Test; the test was easy for me, as I finished 20 minutes ahead of time, but later spot a 6-point-worth mistake.
 Maths has been difficult recently because evaluating double integrals require so many steps, and it’s extremely easy to make mistakes. The concepts are also quite hard to understand. Fortunately, my accuracy is improving in the extensive practice (up to 20 hours a week).
32`On 10/19 I cut my hair, costing $22. It’s been 67 days since my last haircut, making it a new record. I was informed that my VandyHacks application “expired” because I failed to confirm it. That’s so egghurt… My sickness has improved much despite rapidly changing temperature.
33`At night I attended the lecture given by Samantha Power. The lecturer’s ideas represent typical American values: Russians are responsible for the political chaos in USA (and for the atrocity in Syria), Chinese violate human rights by conducting internet censorship, 5 million North Koreans are being tortured in labor camps, the Syrian government uses chemical weapons… all countries that aren’t “democratic” are evil! Like many American elites and media, she also has entrenched prejudices against Trump.
I later watched some news articles about the 19th Party Congress, and was extremely angry at how Western media denigrate the Chinese system and our modern history.
12`On 10/20 I still attended the VandyHacks because 983 accidentally told me that I could go in despite “failed confirmation”. She is a CS major with pretty strong background in programming. Almost all NFLS 2020ers joined the contest. Much of the participants don’t seem to treat the contest quite seriously, except those who came from other schools…
12`On 10/21, 133 tried to learn an extremely powerful game-making software called Unity, and I also managed to make a roll-ball “game” following its tutorial (I could make a Ballance out of this?).
Throughout our contest, 133 did most of the work, while 619 kept talking about the gossip between 139 and 621, gossips about some other high school classmates, and some other very boring topics, and also kept playing King of Glory on her phone.
133 does impress me with his talents and great interest in programming, and so is 983. On 10/22 we submitted 133’s automatic 2048 game, which he finished in a couple of hours.
We later showed our program at the expo, and the scorer said that we’re already doing well since many others’ programs cannot even compile. We all come to admire 133 much.
11`In the afternoon I finished the egghurt Minaj 2.0 Program, with 8.5 hours of work and 500 lines of code in total, making it the most difficult assignment in this term. 139 and 619, struggling more than I do in this homework, complain that they won’t study CS anymore.
33`On 10/22 evening I attended the ASB interview. The interview was pretty embarrassing, since I was asked many abstract questions like “why do you want to do service”, “what’s an experience of your self-reflection”, and even “if you can become a vegetable, which do you want to become”.
I was totally unprepared. I frequently oscillated between formal and informal expressions when speaking (like how I write my Diary), and perhaps because I wasn’t sitting in a comfortable way, my pronunciation was also bad.
24`The interviewers laughed many times when they’re interviewing with the previous student, but I just couldn’t be humorous. I expected to have a good conversation with the four girls, but it turned out that the entire interview was just me struggling to find what to say and how to say.
Alas, my interview skills shouldn’t be that bad (I did pretty well on the InitialView on 9/15/2016 and the two presentations of my Engr modules), but this interview with ASB is definitely a lesson for me.
