13`For weeks, for the Maths homework, I’ve preferred to study the concepts (sometimes by reading Khan Academy articles on my phones when I’m eating meals, etc.) and fully understand them before starting to do homework, according to the advice from the textbook’s intro. This has caused me to be slow when doing Maths homework, and sometimes have to finish the work hurrily on Monday, and in fact when reading the concepts I can’t understand them really. I’ve decided to change that: first plunge right in in HW; no need to figure out the concept before doing HW, but when solving the problems try to understand the concepts. (Actually it’s not necessary to understand deep concepts to cope with Maths…)
34`Recently I’ve been waking up very early but still unable to fall asleep until very late, often spending up to 1.5 hours on bed. My average sleep time of these four days has been only 6 hours. However, I’m not very sleepy during the day (until today).
