31`On 3/12 it snowed in Nashville. It’s my 19th birthday, though I don’t care about this birthday much. In the previous day I explored some cake shops nearby but eventually had to buy some not-so-good cakes in the school. I originally wanted to do nothing for today, but since 545, 139, and 120 helped me a lot in the previous semester, I felt obliged to do something in return or else I would “have no friends” like 962 said. So, I invited all 10 NFLS 2021ers. Before that I reflected on how Rob & Mukhi dealt with the logistics issues in ASB, so that I can organize my own party well.
31`In the afternoon 671 invited me to her birthday meeting tomorrow, so I invited her to mine as well. As many people are busy, the “party” ended up me and three girls playing poker together in our common room: 671, 120, and Amanda. (Amanda is the only American who sent me birthday wishes today, and as she lives on the same floor as me, I also invited her.) No one ate the cake I bought (which is a bit awkward), but I offered plenty of Pineapple Pastry. Few of my previous friends remember my birthday, with the exception of 724 and 811. I didn’t receive any gift, but that’s okay.
