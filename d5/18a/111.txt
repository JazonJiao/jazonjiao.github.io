Now, the desire to study has become so entrenched and irreversible in me that my study efficiency soon recovered, within hours. Within about 2.5 years, I’ve gradually built up a powerful “study inertia” and resilience to setbacks and distractions that reached its peak in April 2016. Since 2017, I would feel intensely uncomfortable if I don’t learn anything new in a day.
