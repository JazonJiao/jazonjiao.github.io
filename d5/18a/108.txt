32`I went back to the US on 1/6. This time, the flight from Nanjing to LA didn’t go from the Bering Strait, but instead traveled along the 30° latitude. I calculated the difference in the distance of these two paths, and was very satisfied at how I used newly learned Maths knowledge to solve problems in life. I hope to find more Maths problems like this to think about in my spare time.
31`After arriving at LA on 1/6 morning, it was 13 hours before our flight to Nashville is due. I accidentally encountered 909 and decided to visit UCLA. I spent the afternoon sleeping on the sofa in he and 232’s dorm, and then ate dinner and briefly toured the campus. “That’s when having a good friend becomes super useful,” I thought. I also got to know 602, another NFLSer in UCLA.
31`909 lives in a 6-person suit with 2 3-person rooms. Their roommates also spend quite a long time playing video games. Unfortunately, there is no air conditioning in his dorm, and he has to use a fan in summer. The climate is mild here, and there was only one rainy day in the previous semester!
31`909 is also majoring in Maths and planning to double CS (so is 232) and planning to work after graduation. However, to major in CS he will have to go through the competitive admissions process of the Engineering School, and if he fails he’ll just graduate with a Maths degree.
31`At UCLA, there are 3 semesters each year. Because there is no affirmative action in the admissions process, Asians have a great advantage: of the 8,000 students in one grade, more than 30% are of Asian descent, excluding 200 international Chinese students.
21`At UCLA, the requirements for graduation are very low. 909 knows a xuezhang who graduated in 2 years with double major Maths and Physics, but does not know where he ended up. 909 says that although he can technically finish all courses in less than 2 years, he doesn’t want to do so.
31`In his spare time, 909 sometimes watches American TV series on NetFlix. 909 advises me to ride less bikes and do more weightlifting, as I don’t need to lose fat but instead need more muscles.
