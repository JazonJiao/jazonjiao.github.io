14`Recently I’ve been struggling to decide whether I should still apply to the CS-2201 TA position next semester. I originally decided that I will only apply to CS-3251, and if I don’t get in, I will just work on the ELR Project. Just to be polite, I wrote a draft for a letter to Professor Roth, paying great attention to my tone:
<em>
11`Dear Professor Roth:
11`Thank you for all your effort and care this semester! It’s been an incredible experience working with you, as I’ve been deeply inspired by your spirit of rigor and dedication. The time spent on grading assignments increased my understanding of C++ and data structures, and holding office hours is a great way to meet people and practice my speaking skills. These will be essential assets when I apply for 2020 summer internships next year this time!
14`However, next semester I will probably step down from the CS-2201 TA position. It’s a tough decision, but I’d like to put this 140-hour worth of effort into something more challenging.
14`I’m planning to start a YouTube channel and make videos explaining linear algebra concepts (or other interesting Math/CS stuff) in a similar fashion to 3Blue1Brown, the best Math YouTube channel. 3b1b built a huge Python library for doing Math animations, manim.py, and I might use his library, or I might also try JavaScript (p5.js or processing.js) for some/all of my animations. It will be a lot of work, but it’s also super exciting!
11`Wish you a wonderful break and keep in touch! —Jazon

24`Still, I was thinking whether it’s appropriate for me to only apply for CS-3251. Would it be a bit arrogant to do so, especially after Prof. Roth encouraged me to stay? Sure, I am doing a pretty good job grading projects, but when it comes to office hours and answering questions, my abilities cannot compare to others like Matthew.
24`But I still think the professor will understand my pursuit of a higher position, and maybe even be glad for it. I originally wanted to talk to him and ask for his attitude, but eventually just wrote the letter. I gave him the letter on 12/13 and applied for 3251 TA.
21`Of course, my motivation for TA-ing this class mainly comes from the fact that 492 and 478 are both offered internships from Facebook, so I think the ISD TA position must be superior to 2201. But in fact, maybe I could learn more if I TA for CS-2201, since it’s more focused on logic and data structures, which are more directly relevant to me, whereas design patterns are all about OOP, and sometimes you even have to recite.
11`And indeed, even after TA-ing for a semester, I don’t think my grasp on some CS-2201 concepts is solid enough, so it never hurts to practice more. Also, some of my peers who are taking this course next semester have also asked me to stay for the 2201 TA position.
11`But still, this is a lot of time commitment and not that much money paid, so I need to decide carefully. In the semester, I have reported 144 hours of work—which is a lot, and although not all 144 hours is fully spent working, I did spend a lot of extra hours helping my peers—329, 359, 979, and so on—with their coursework. (In return, 329 invited me to dinner many times.)
11`As to payment, I’ve earned a total of $1333.57+, a little over ¥10,000, not even enough to cover my flight tickets for winter vacation. Also, by the end of the semester I was becoming less motivated to do the grading work, since it is becoming a bit tedious and repetitive.
11`We had a 4th grading session on 12/13. I was the first to arrive, and after all grading is done, Dr. Roth invited all TA’s present (about 7 out of 20 TA’s) to pizza. He asked us for suggestions and comments on the course; I said there should be more opportunities for TA’s to get to know each other, while some others suggest giving TA’s name tags during office hours.
11`In the end Dr. Roth talked about how he calculates the final grade. There are no curves, just hard cutoff lines. Then he showed us the grade distribution of last semester. Only 14% (24 people) got an A, 8% got an A-, 14% got a B+, 32% got a B, and the rest 32% are B- or less. There are even 4 D’s and 5 fails?!
11`This is much to my surprise—the scoring is really aggressive! I later saw my rank, and it was actually lower than I expected (7th, score 94.5%, rank 4%). I don’t know who the top scorers are, but somehow, they’re not TA-ing this semester. Dr. Roth says sometimes there are even people getting A+ (97%+)!
11`After all grades are posted, I realized that the distribution of scores for Chinese students isn’t as high as I thought. The most competitive students are predominantly non-Chinese. Comparing this to the grades of the NFLSers in our grade, NFLSers are so outstanding…
