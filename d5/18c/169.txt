11`By 11/8 I finished 3 quizzes + 1 mid-term in a single week. I got 98 (out of 105) on the Math-2420 exam; class average is 84. By the way, my score on the first Diff Eq exam was 90, and class average was somewhere near 80. I am doing better and better at the ISD quizzes, my score rising steadily from 74% on the 1st Quiz to 100% by the 6th Quiz.
13`Although I have a lot of motivation to do things recently, my efficiency isn’t high because I have to deal with my coursework. These coursework are beneficial, yes, but sometimes they are tangential to what I really want to specialize in.
13`How I wish I can have enough time to focus on my project! If a vacation starts now, I will be very motivated to work relentlessly on it. Now I can understand why 982 says he only wants a minor in CS. Much of the knowledge isn’t super useful.
11`The ES-2100 class, though, is giving me a lot of insights into my ELR Project. Audience analysis, learning strategy, speech techniques—enthusiasm, visuals, organization…
11`Of course, I’ve also combined the powerful design patterns from CS3251 with the ELR Project. It’s really fascinating to see that software can be implemented in such an organized, clean structure using OOP. Many classes seem to be so dumb—just a few methods with one line of code—but they’re still necessary!
12`Indeed, I need to figure out a way to encapsulate the objects in my animations, and organize the structure in a clever way. I need to make my code as reusable as possible. To help with this, I recently researched 3b1b’s source code on GitHub.
11`I exploded on the Comp Org quiz, getting perhaps the first below-average score on any exam since college life (2.5% below median). Now with 4.5 points deducted, and since only 50% of the grade has been assigned for this course, my situation seems dangerous. I’m not spending a due amount of time on this course, though. What would it mean if I get an A-?
11`Oh, did I forget to mention course registration? I didn’t get into almost all classes I want, except computer graphics, which is what I’m interested in but which seems to have a horrible professor. Now I have enrolled in several junk courses, hoping to get off of the waitlist next semester.
14`Since I was aiming for 3 years of graduation, I’ve actually already completed some of the most difficult courses in '18 Spr and '18 Fall. This gives me a solid knowledge foundation and will enable me to focus on the things I want to do in the next several years of school life, since now it’s almost certain that I’ll not choose to graduate in 3 years (maybe 3.5) and I’ll have less busy lives in the future.
13`This semester is really hectic, and my body condition is often not satisfactory. As mentioned before, I can only barely finish my coursework (especially for CS 2212 and 2231), without thinking more deeply about what I learned, like in the previous semester.
11`Of course, for CS-3251 and Math-3670, I’ve been always aiming for a deeper understanding beyond what’s required to get an A, since they relate the most directly to my career goals.
12`Recently 359, 979, and 329 contacted me a lot for CS-2201 help (and sometimes even Digital Logic), and I spent a lot of time helping them with homework. I met with 979 on 11/6 at night to help her prepare for the exam, and she actually impressed me with her attitudes.
31`329 is much politer and friendlier than 359, and has offered me a lot of food… He says 026 likes to say “JCW is so smart” whenever he encounters difficulties when solving problems? I replied that you guys are treating me as your Yang Chaoyue… This really motivates me, though.
