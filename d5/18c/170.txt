31`On 11/10 night I watched the Diwali Showcase, which is awesome. I later attended the LNYF interest meeting and decided to attend a dance! After a very hectic and painful week, Week 12, at the time I intensely yearned to take some time off next semester.
34`My stomach started to feel bad starting 11/10 night, and my body almost completely collapsed on 11/12 and 11/13, as I had to stay on the bed for several hours in the day and I did nothing those two days (well, I watched a ton of YouTube science videos, as always).
34`I felt much better after 11/14 morning and as of now (11/15) I’m feeling very well. My body has collapsed whenever the week’s number is odd, and Week 13 is no exception. Fortunately, I don’t have major tests/exams this week.
12`In fact, this is the most chill week in a month, and there is virtually nothing to do! On 11/14 afternoon I decided on the class inheritance structure for my “Manim.js” library, and at night I spent 5 hours to finish the logo animation, which is really awesome.
12`11/15 is spent researching linear algebra concepts and looking more deeply into 3b1b’s manim.py. The outline of the video series is becoming clearer, and the intense desire to meet and cooperate with 3b1b (as well as other fantastic people such as carykh) is a huge stimulus for me to learn programming and linear algebra when I’m not under pressure.
32`On 11/14 it was very cold, and it almost snowed. On 11/16 night, Mom booked the flight home—12/16 to 1/3, meaning I can stay home for 2 and a half weeks. The price was a little over $2,000. I then played guandan with 671, 120, and ljy.
31`On 11/17, 619’s parents came and the 9 NFLSers had dinners together (120 went to Chicago). 619 and her parents expressed much admiration for my CS skills; at dinner we discussed our recent love experiences.
24`This week I also joined a group chat created by Cherry, a NFLSer 6 years older than me, that aims to help NFLSers set up networks and seek jobs. She posted some information about data science this weekend.
21`After I shared my information with her (I said I want to become a data-oriented software engineer), she says that it’d be unlikely to get an offer from giant tech companies without internship experience sophomore year, and urges me to apply to internships, even at small start-ups, for next summer.
21`Cherry says that she can help me find NFLS mentors at those giant companies to provide paid tutorship; they have already successfully helped several NFLSers gain offers.
21`Now (11/17 night) I’m thinking very carefully about the implications of her message and still haven’t replied yet. I don’t believe that I can’t end up well without an internship next summer. I have no shortage of skillsets to impress employers in the long run, and I’m confident in myself now that my ELR project has taken off.
13`When there is no pressure exerted on me, the influence of 3b1b takes over and my powerful self-motivation breaks free (compare this to Week 12, when I was lost in preparing for exams; also compare to late May, when I was very motivated to learn math at home). I spent half a day researching linear algebra as well as how to write better JavaScript code, thinking about strategies to structure my program and even make it easier for others to use my library’s interface.
12`The ELR is such a perfect project for enhancing my abilities in Math and CS! It’s also an excellent way to hone my tech comm skills and can even shed light on marketing strategies and other economics knowledge.
31`(BTW, I just noticed that I mentioned 3b1b a total of 17 times in the past 3 months—he’s one of my most mentioned person!)
24`On 11/21 night I finally replied to Cherry that I will start doing networking and preparing for interviews from about next July on, by which time her platform would become extremely useful. To my surprise, she didn’t encourage me but instead replied pretty harshly, emphasizing the impossibility of ending up well if I don’t prepare early.
24`When a zhongjie make these claims, they probably intentionally aim to make students nervous, so that we are more likely to use their service. Therefore, I will not be swayed by her words.
