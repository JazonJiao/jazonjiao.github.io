<h2>2019 ICPC Contest</h2>
<p id="1"><span>①</span> On 10/5 I teamed up with 133 and 139, and attended ICPC (previously known as ACM). I hardly prepared for it, and figured out how to correctly read inputs with Python 3 merely 30 minutes before the contest.</p>
<p id="2"><span>②</span> The contest turned out a very pleasant experience for me. With a solid foundation in data structures, I solved 3 problems—I am the only person in our school to solve Prob. G, Research Productivity Index! It’s actually a very fun DP problem, and I love to see my program getting accepted!</p>
<p id="3"><span>③</span> In the end, we together attempted 10 problems out of 13, solving 7. We ranked 1st in our school, and will represent our school at the mid-central US regional contest on 11/2! The 2nd ranking team also solved 7 problems but with slightly more cumulative time (735 vs 753 minutes). 982, 026, and yc’s team solved 6 and ranked 3rd; the 4th-ranked team consists of zrd, tyh and another Chinese student.</p>
<p id="4"><span>④</span> Looking at the results from other school really expanded my outlook and helped to put my abilities in context. 139 says that 146 and 315 entered World finals last year, and 106 (Ding Lihuang) got gold medals at the World finals.</p>
<p id="5"><span>⑤</span> 139, 133, and 619 went to the mid-central regionals last year, and got 25th out of 125 teams (146 and 315 got 2nd place). 139 didn’t put this on his resume, though; he says that interviewers will ask harder questions if you say you have attended ICPC.</p>
<p id="6"><span>⑥</span> Being able to represent our school makes me super excited, and I told 293, 495, and 983 about the news. From 10/6, I begin to read Crack Code and work on Leetcode again. Even though we won’t stand a chance for the World finals (you have to be top 2 in our region), I am aiming at a top 10!</p>
<p id="7"><span>⑦</span> How I wish I can Leetcode every day, like I did in the summer! If so, I can be entirely alone for weeks without feeling lonely! Now I’m distracted by schoolwork and PhD applications, and the thing about schoolwork is that I need to constantly spend energy understanding concepts I don’t love (especially CS 3270 and Math 3320), and this makes me inefficient and in need of external emotional support.</p>
<p id="8"><span>⑧</span> Follow-up: On 11/2, I, 133, and 139 competed in the ICPC regionals, hosted at TN Tech. We got 1st place among Tennessee teams, and 18th Place among all mid-central U.S. teams; many top-ranked teams come from UIUC.</p>
<p id="9"><span>⑨</span> Although we ranked 1st after solving the 3rd problem at the 27th minute and tried really hard afterwards, we didn’t manage to solve a single problem in the next 4 hours until we finally got Problem D right (133 and 139 solved it in C++ but got TLE, and I recoded their logic in Python and got accepted), which raised our ranking from 21st to 18th.</p>
<p id="10"><span>⑩</span> I later got a GHC17 bag during the prize draw; the other prizes are mostly JetBrains and ACM stuff.</p>
