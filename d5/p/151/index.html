<div class="row d-flex" id="rdf">
<p id="1"><span>①</span> On 7/26 morning, after 4 hours of trial and error, I finally figured out how to use Python and recursion to generate a 2D array that stores all combinations of n choose k (for example, 3 choose 1 returns [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]). This gives many new insights into how to solve a problem, as for 2 hours or so I was headed in the wrong direction. I finally realized that the return type of base cases should also be 2D arrays instead of 1D arrays.</p>
<p id="2"><span>②</span> I spent another hour figuring out what’s wrong with my permutation algorithm (for example, permutation of 3 returns [[0, 1, 2], [0, 2, 1], [1, 0, 2], [1, 2, 0], [2, 0, 1], [2, 1, 0]]), which always alters my original array for each recursive call. I eventually found that function calls in Python passes by “object reference” instead of value, so I added a B = A.copy() to solve the problem.</p>
<p id="3"><span>③</span> On 8/4 I successfully solved the problem of generating all ~ n!/e derangements of a given array (for example, derangements of 3 returns [[1, 2, 0], [2, 0, 1]). This is another challenging recursive problem in combinatorics, and my ability to think abstractly enhanced greatly.</p>
<p id="4"><span>④</span> At precisely the midnight of July 31 (0:00 of Aug 1) Beijing time, I finished the 1,000th quiz as I attempted the 6,000th problem on Brilliant—another milestone of my Math learning. The goal of solving 5,000 problems during the summer is within my grasp, and I’m now so used to studying that I spend less and less time writing Diaries about my academics.</p>
<p id="5"><span>⑤</span> Recently Mom’s mother come to Nanjing while she’s frequently away. I and my grandma take care of each other. This feels strangely good on my side: when mum is present, I feel somewhat controlled, and when grandma is present, I have to do more stuff but I like being independent.</p>
<p id="6"><span>⑥</span> On 7/29 night I attended the NFLS inter-grade King Cup, representing class of ’17. Our team lost 0:6, but without me, it could have been 0:10+… the result is less important than the health it brings, though. Fortunately Nanjing isn’t super hot this summer.</p>
<p id="7"><span>⑦</span> On 7/31 morning I took a glance at some Jiangsu Gaokao problems. Maths feels easy, since I’ve been spending thousands of hours learning it, although I’m not good at conic sections, which isn’t covered a lot in my recent learning but which is emphasized in Gaokao.</p>
<p id="8"><span>⑧</span> Chinese is really hard, and, surprisingly, so is history—although I know a lot of historical facts, the tests are testing a particular way of understanding history. Anyway, with my present momentum, if I go back to Grade 12 and attend the Gaokao, I’m confident that I’ll get into C9.</p>
<p id="9"><span>⑨</span> I desire to attend social activities just like the PanoFair on 7/14. I kind of need to see and talk to (good-looking) girls on a regular basis to keep my mental health, and to be with aspirant peers to provide motivation. Now I’m just too lazy and stay at home every day, although I keep studying 4~6 hours every day.</p>
<p id="10"><span>⑩</span> On 8/4 I attended the Third Place match and our team got the fourth (last) place but still everyone got a beautiful medal. Later I talked to 909 about some topics in CS, and he says that many profs teaching in UCLA are dashens that got champions in math competitions, but the class size is too big and when they teach, they often expect the students to understand difficult concepts easily…</p>
<p id="11"><span>⑪</span> On 8/6 I briefly read about some integration tricks, and pondered on the philosophy of mathematics. As I concluded earlier, the fundamental principle of solving a problem—whether mathematical or interpersonal—is that you should analyze information in your head constantly. You should definitely avoid thinking in only one direction, easily wasting hours of time at a dead end. To achieve this, you need a versatile toolkit of problem-solving techniques.</p>
