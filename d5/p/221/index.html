<div class="row d-flex" id="rdf">
<p id="1"><span>①</span> On 6/13 I gave a presentation in the Class of 2023 Group about CS course selections. I spent about 6 hours preparing for this, and writing the script was a great way for me to reflect on my college life in the Chinese language.</p>
<p id="2"><span>②</span> On 6/14 night I and 6 other people, including 619, 495, and 469, played the murder mystery game (Chinese: “Script Kill”) together in xuezhang Austin’s house. At first glance, Austin is the kind of person who likes to brag and dislikes studies, but he turned out very hospitable and friendly.</p>
<p id="3"><span>③</span> The script turned out pretty long and boring, so people just started talking about losing weight, eating habits, and working out. We later played “the Resistance” (Chinese: Avalon) and had a very good time until 3:30. This is the latest that I’ve ever played with my friends.</p>
<p id="4"><span>④</span> On 6/15 the CHIA group along with 477 ate a delicious lunch in 120’s home, and then traveled to Belmont University. I said “travel” because now, going outside of the campus to somewhere I’ve never been counts as traveling, even when that place is less than 1 kilometer from our school.</p>
<p id="5"><span>⑤</span> On 6/22 I invited 042 for dinner at Lucky Bamboo, and we talked nonstop for 2 and half hours. 042 is coming to the Owen school of management for an intense 4-week program where he gains real, hands-on experience with consulting in big companies. I first met 042 in <a href="../153/">D5P153-180816</a>, and I know that he’s one of the most talented people I can meet in a long time, so I was actually nervous about this meeting.</p>
<p id="6"><span>⑥</span> Our conversation is, as before, extremely intellectual and technical, although our paths are starkly different—he hasn’t taken any CS/Math/AI classes in college, while I know nothing about businesses.</p>
<p id="7"><span>⑦</span> 042 is studying Sociology and Business now and planning to graduate in 3 years to attend a competitive business master’s program at Emory. He explained the differences between Business and Econ, and the different branches of business (accounting, finance, actuaries, management…). I explained some basic principles of machine learning, with examples I used when giving presentations at the ES-2100W class.</p>
<p id="8"><span>⑧</span> While talking to him, he points out that I’m probably going back to China in the long run. I said, maybe the Chinese culture of steadiness and hard work suits my personality more. I’ve never actually realized this, until I said it.</p>
<p id="9"><span>⑨</span> While my parents insist that I pursue cutting-edge technologies, I’ve been more and more disinterested in academia. It’s an even riskier path: who knows whether your research direction is the right path or not, and you can easily waste many years of your youth into something meaningless—look at what happened to some of Phillip’s colleagues in his the PhD Grind! If I have that time, why not expand my skillset further?</p>
<p id="10"><span>⑩</span> Business seems to be an important skill to have. When I talked to my lab-mate 273 on Friday, he said when he was once interviewed by a UPenn graduate, and the interviewer was a programmer but rose through the ranks at a tech company thanks to some background in business.</p>
<p id="11"><span>⑪</span> Of course, I know that businesspeople are busy: 042’s current program requires 14 hours of work every day. But well, I guess that much of the work don’t require as much level of concentration as learning CS.</p>
<p id="12"><span>⑫</span> 042 has 3 elder sisters working for Google, Facebook, and Amazon respectively, and 2 of them are programmers. I asked for their referral, but 042 said that it’s not as important as I think and that I should spend less time networking and more time studying. We talked extensively about the differences in business and CS/Math careers. Although 042 discourages me to seek to WST-like companies for help, I don’t think I can handle some of the challenges alone.</p>
<p id="13"><span>⑬</span> 042 doesn’t think WST’s referral-offering service is useful, but I think the biggest problem is with my self-positioning. Without clear information of how I compare with other candidates, I cannot choose my strategies wisely. What if my efforts are bound to be futile, just like NLC didn’t let me apply to Top-10 universities? Also, I only know of several large companies like Facebook.</p>
<p id="14"><span>⑭</span> In fact, two WST counselors have personally messaged me about their upcoming event in Shanghai (although it’s on 7/7 and I can’t go). Sometimes I would think to myself, “if there is a counselor, will s/he agree me to do this?</p>
<p id="15"><span>⑮</span> I also got to know that 955 is interning at Citi now; 042 says that she’s quite hardworking. Most of 042’s friends are American, though. Emory, like Vandy, is generous in giving domestic students aids, so many Americans admitted by HYP come to Emory. In the end, he encouraged me that I’ll succeed in GRE and coding interviews. I said, I don’t know if he could spare some time if I have a chance to meet him in the future.</p>
<p id="16"><span>⑯</span> Afterwards, I added 042 on LinkedIn and found that 863 and 982 also know him. I look at the posts he likes, and learn about how to post my achievements and experience on LinkedIn.</p>
