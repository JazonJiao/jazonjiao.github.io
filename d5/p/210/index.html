<div class="row d-flex" id="rdf" style="margin-bottom: 199px;">
<p id="1"><span>①</span> By 5/1 I’ve finished all work for this semester, except for grading CS-3251 tests. For grading ISD exams, Prof. Hemingway only gave a pretty vague answer, and we have to set up the rubric ourselves. This is strangely satisfying for me since I have great control over the grading. I set up detailed rubric and feedback for the problems I graded, I saw some other TA’s only gave very vague rubrics.</p>
<p id="2"><span>②</span> My semester ended with all A’s, with A+’s on CS-3258 and 3281. I kind of expected an A+ on CS-3250; I eventually got an A, and there’s no way of knowing how well I did on the finals since the professor doesn’t update any of our scores on Brightspace. My cumulative GPA is now 3.982. Summer break started on 5/3.</p>
<p id="3"><span>③</span> In the past one month, I concentrated on studies and declined many social activities, such as the ASB reunion. Now that the finals are finished and many of my peers are gone, I feel lonely and wish to socialize, but no longer have the chance. Alas…</p>
<p id="4"><span>④</span> In the first few days of the summer break, I was constantly dizzy in the day. I know it’s because I wasn’t eating much—often only 1.5 to 2 meals a day. I was lazy to get food since I wasn’t feeling too hungry. But now I realized that just because I’m not hungry doesn’t mean I shouldn’t eat as usual…</p>
<p id="5"><span>⑤</span> Continuing my observation of my behavior during this semester, an interesting thing to note is what period of my history I tend to reflect. Back in '18 Spr, I spent significant time thinking about my study system in GR2 and especially April 2016 of GR3.</p>
<p id="6"><span>⑥</span> However, in '18 Spr I tend to think about summer 2016, when my motivation declined and I entered a more stable, less intense mode of studying, and also 2017, when a period of prolonged relaxation helped me gain the motivation that released in early 2018. I also think about the 12/12 sometimes, like in winter break, but much less April 2016. This shows the fact that I find more resonance with those less intense periods.</p>
<p id="7"><span>⑦</span> Another interesting perspective about my loss of sense of achievement is that the ratio between the amount of new stuff I learned and my knowledge base is getting increasingly smaller.</p>
<p id="8"><span>⑧</span> Added on 5/20: after being inspired how Guo’s productivity, motivation, and morals oscillated in his book the PhD Grind, I can now conclude a lesson. It’s not possible to keep being productive all the time like in '18 Spr—there will inevitably be times when I’m efficient and times when I’m not. I would be fragile and easy to collapse if I base my confidence solely on my speed of progress, so I should have the resilience to overcome the pain when I reach some dead ends or things get tough.</p>
<p id="9"><span>⑨</span> On 5/2 at 1:20 AM, I accidentally met 493, who was walking with a boy, supposedly her teammate at Facebook. On 5/2 noon I met 488 and talked to her for basically the first time this semester, when she sent me the Crack Code book and we toured EBI for about 20 minutes. I actually already have the book and read it briefly this January after the career fair, but I just wanted to talk to 488.</p>
<p id="10"><span>⑩</span> I once asked 488 if 493 had a boyfriend, expecting a positive answer, but she said she didn’t know, and didn’t seem to care about this issue… Later that day I asked 493 if we could meet sometime, and she kindly declined. After such a long separation, I have to admit that my feelings for 493 has almost depleted.</p>
<p id="11"><span>⑪</span> My word count for this semester is 19878 words, as of 5/20.</p>
