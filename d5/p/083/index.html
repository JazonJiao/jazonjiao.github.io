<h1 id="0">D5P83-171002</h1>
<div class="row d-flex" id="rdf">
<p id="1"><span>①</span> In the afternoon in our Visions group meeting, we built marshmallow towers in groups of five, and although I joined with another civil engineer Matt, our tower ultimately failed.</p>
<p id="2"><span>②</span> My design was like the Oriental Peral tower of Shanghai, with 3 thick pillows supporting the entire structure, but successful towers turned out to be those with thin but net-like pillars.</p>
<p id="3"><span>③</span> Joey, whose tower succeeded, told me that it’s important to add connections in the side so that the structure doesn’t twist. That’d be an important lesson for a civil engineer!</p>
<p id="4"><span>④</span> This morning we had the Gen Psy mid-term test. I started preparing for it since 6 PM yesterday until 2 AM; Knowing the test will be harder than expected, I realized that I wasted too much time in the weekend.</p>
<p id="5"><span>⑤</span> I tried to read and let concepts click with my mind, leaving a vague “neural path” that will suffice for multiple choice questions, because rigid reciting is definitely ineffective not only for memorizing, but also for long-term benefits in mindset.</p>
<p id="6"><span>⑥</span> The test was indeed very hard. I relied on the xueba that sat right in front of me to get about 3 problems correct. The final score was 50/61, only two points away from the 80% deadline. By 9 PM 150 people have signed up for the retake, indicating the rigor of the exam.</p>
<p id="7"><span>⑦</span> 979 later talked to me about how she exploded in the exam; she’s contacted me 7 times but I’ve done none from my side, but I have an intuition that we’re not necessarily the best fit, so I’ll just treat her as a friend. My friendship with 671 is also developing quickly; in my conversations with her I never struggle to come up with topics because she does most of the job.</p>
<p id="8"><span>⑧</span> The score of the CS test also came out today; I scored a very unexpected 94, 133 got 88, 139 got 84, class average below 70. The score was placed in spam so I initially didn’t find it; on discovering the spam section I found that BOA sent a lot of emails to me…</p>
<p id="9"><span>⑨</span> After learning the score, I was astonished. By now except for the Chinese history test, on which I should have gotten good scores, mid-terms are complete, and my performance has exceeded my best anticipation. Math, top 10% of class (me 102 and 139 98); CS, top 10% of class despite no reviewing at all… Full A’s in this term seem so close at hand.</p>
<p id="10"><span>⑩</span> I spent half an hour calming myself down: am I really more talented than I thought? If I can maintain this impetus, should I plan to transfer to UPenn or Northwestern or Duke or Cornell? Or is it, like 496 said, just very easy for all Chinese to get all A’s?</p>
<p id="11"><span>⑪</span> Will my impetus wane, just like I dropped from top 5 of Class 4 in The 1-2 Test in Oct 2014, to top 50% In The 1-4 Test in Jan 2015? (Not quite likely, since I’ve analyzed the reasons for this numerous times and will avoid past mistakes now.)</p>
<p id="12"><span>⑫</span> Recently I’ve spent a great deal of time thinking about my future plans, especially major choice (if continue the civil path, I might really consider transfer?).</p>
<p id="13"><span>⑬</span> My ChemE teacher has provided some good info about career planning: GPA is only top 3 important for those entering workforce, but if you want to enter a top-notch grad school, a 3.9 GPA will be crucial.</p>
<p id="14"><span>⑭</span> PhDs are good for Chemistry majors, but not necessary for engineers because they learn applied side of knowledge, except if engineers want to research the fields that are so cutting-edge that they’re not yet applied to real-world.</p>
<p id="15"><span>⑮</span> Added on 171006: Because of excessive naps in previous days, I cannot sleep now... damn it. Just now I browsed the WeChat pages of many of my friends. This is for the first time since 6/19, and it is indeed a great way to relax and adjust myself, although it’s important that I don’t get addicted to it.</p>
<p id="16"><span>⑯</span> WeChat usage among my friends is below my expectation. Apparently boys use it a lot less than girls; maybe because of this, boys are generally far less popular than girls in Moments.</p>
<p id="17"><span>⑰</span> Among all of my friends, the page of 671 was one of the most impressive, as she shows maturity and a good personality, and excellent Chinese expression skills.</p>
<p id="18"><span>⑱</span> One thing to note here is that many of my friends might have chosen FB or Snapchat or even LinkedIn as their new platform of socializing; after all, these are what Americans use most often. I also wonder if Qzone usage has significantly declined; my glimpse of 139’s phone when he was browsing Qzone tells me no.</p>
<p id="19"><span>⑲</span> Compared to September, my drowsiness during the day has decreased much. However, because I can’t control my nap during the day, my sleep cycle keeps shifting late into the night: from 9 PM when first arrived to 3 AM in just a few weeks.</p>
<p id="20"><span>⑳</span> According to past experiences, my sleep time is supposed to be stable, but since college starts I’ve frequently experienced insomnia. The all-nighter today might be a good chance for me to readjust my circadian cycle. I might also want to consider going to libraries to prevent myself from sleeping during the day, sleeping only by lying on the table, not bed.</p>
<p id="21"><span>㉑</span> My Chinese History test score was much lower than I expected, partly because I didn’t follow the format in the essay, which the teacher never told us beforehand. I can only hope for an A- in this course now.</p>
<p id="22"><span>㉒</span> Since then, I have developed a fear towards social science subjects. Despite the setback, I still like this course and our teacher, because the things I learned here has long-term benefits that won’t be explicit but will eventually benefit me.</p>
<p id="23"><span>㉓</span> Added on 171008: Today I applied for the Alternative Spring Break. My essays for application are stored in another document. Yesterday I finished this round of ACT tutor work and earned about ¥1000. I am still coughing, and so are many of my friends, who have suffered from the great temperature difference between indoors and outdoors.</p>
<p id="24"><span>㉔</span> 227 and 204 have come for the fall break, and I was uninformed at all although I am the only one from Class 2. What happened to the relationship between me and my friends?</p>
<p id="25"><span>㉕</span> Typically I don’t hang out with the Gang of Four (133, 139, 413, 544) when eating dinner, etc., because I think these guys only talk about boring things (though they’re all pretty smart in studies). I prefer to spend that time socializing with someone else or just using my phone.</p>
<p id="26"><span>㉖</span> The cost to this is obvious: I tend to be excluded when they attend some good activities together. This is neither side’s fault but a natural outcome of my not sticking to them. 120 didn’t come to our meetings throughout; I concluded that she doesn’t like to hang out with other NFLSers.</p>
