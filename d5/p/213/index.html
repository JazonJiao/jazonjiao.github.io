<div class="row d-flex" id="rdf">
<p id="1"><span>①</span> On 5/5, we took the 15:10 bus back to Nashville. Unlike when we came, the Megabus set out only 3 minutes later than due time. 671 and 120 decided to visit Civil rights museum since they have the city pass, so they almost missed the bus.</p>
<p id="2"><span>②</span> On the way back, I sat at the upper level of the bus, and the scenery along the road was splendid. I know I need to cherish this scenery, so I looked outside most of the time. On campus you never see green mountain ranges tens of miles away under the sunshine, or lakes that stretch into the horizon—you don’t really get to see anything farther than a mile, in fact, and that’s what makes campus life rather depressing.</p>
<p id="3"><span>③</span> After going back to school, I, 120, and 671 went “shopping” in the Towers donation bins and took some stuff home, although this is not technically permitted.</p>
<p id="4"><span>④</span> On 5/8 and 5/9 I took 6 trips to move all of my stuff to 026 and 982’s apartment. I’ve been feeling sleepy and not energetic for several days, as I’m sleeping too much and eating not enough.</p>
<p id="5"><span>⑤</span> I really enjoyed this year’s UCL semifinals! I really didn’t expect Spurs would score in the last second, so I turned off the TV after the goal kick was given at the 94th minute, and I regret it so much…</p>
<p id="6"><span>⑥</span> On 5/10 morning I watched the graduation ceremony with 671 and her friend, and they explained to me the meaning of “cum laude:” “summa cum laude” is top 5% GPA (3.936), “magna cum laude” is top 13% (3.856), “cum laude” is top 25% (3.772). The cutoff scores have risen much over the past few years, maybe because of both a rise of student abilities and the inflation of grades. My GPA now is 3.982, so I guess I’m in the top… 2%? 1%?</p>
<p id="7"><span>⑦</span> Even with such a pretty high percentile, I don’t feel super proud of myself. I’m used to a good score and have been placing expectations on myself beyond grades. As I said, I’ve been dissatisfied with my performance this semester: I don’t spend as much time studying, and I don’t have clear future plans. Also, my obsession with grades has often consumed too much of my energy and thus obstructed me to do things outside of classroom.</p>
<p id="8"><span>⑧</span> On 5/10 afternoon, I went to Dallas, where the family of a high school classmate of my father’s will take care of me for the next 9 days. On 5/11 I slipped while having a bath, and broke their toilet… On 5/15 I and uncle Yang walked along the “Cottonwood Trail.” The scenery is good, although far less so than many of Nanjing’s parks.</p>
<p id="9"><span>⑨</span> On 5/16 we walked along the other side of the trail. There are a lot of luxurious houses along the way, and I was shocked by them after living in “poverty” (school dormitory) for such a long time. Uncle Yang explains that those communities are built in the past 20 years. Some of the houses have broken roofs because of the hail—the climate here is pretty bad.</p>
