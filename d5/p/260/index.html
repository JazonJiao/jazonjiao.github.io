<div class="row d-flex" id="rdf">
<p id="1"><span>①</span> Recently I like to take a lonely stroll in campus or nearby and enjoy beautiful autumn scenery. On 11/15 I stumbled upon a hill on Love Circle near 32nd Ave where I can have a bird’s eye view of the entire city, and it’s marvelous! The number of times I went out of campus for more than 1 km remains at 4 times this semester, since the hill is less than 500 meters from the campus.</p>
<p id="2"><span>②</span> After the productive Tuesday, I spent the following 3 days mostly idle. I feel that I’ve learned enough knowledge, and the only thing missing is more research or work experience. At this stage, it’s far more important to prove myself in actual impactful projects than to learn more stuff, which no longer contributes to my profile.</p>
<p id="3"><span>③</span> 360 has been working on neural networks in a medical lab, and I have looked into the lab’s professors. For the sake of recommendations, it might be better to have continuity in my research. But it’d be best for me to publish papers. Maybe ask Kunda?</p>
<p id="4"><span>④</span> When doing Math 3320 homework, I recalled the modular arithmetic I learned in 2018 summer. When doing AI practice problems, 3b1b’s Bayesian probability videos that I watched in Sept. 2018 became really useful.</p>
<p id="5"><span>⑤</span> I’m also planning on a critical personal project—a reflection of my college life from the three perspectives of academics, social, and love, projected to publish on Zhihu in May and maybe CSSA’s public account.</p>
<p id="6"><span>⑥</span> On 11/16, 329 finished an online assessment from InterSystems, a medical database company. On 11/18 morning I sent the recommendation links from Stanford, CMU, and UCLA.</p>
<p id="7"><span>⑦</span> On 11/18 evening I talked briefly with 488, who’s starting her FB job on 2/28 next year. She told me that 481 is now a data scientist at Microsoft and does a lot of machine learning, which is impressive for a bachelor’s graduate. I said that if she doesn’t get into FB, I’ll have a strong competitor for CMU MSML; 488 commented that she won’t apply since she’s “not smart enough” to do ML…</p>
<p id="8"><span>⑧</span> On 11/18 night, I and 698 gathered in Kissam to study for Math 3320 exam. For about half of the 3 hours, instead of studying, we had very deep conversations; she talked a lot about how her personal values shifted during her sophomore year. Like me, she was super stressful in '18 Fall; she was immersed in self-doubt about whether she suits the finance path after a summer program at Owen.</p>
<p id="9"><span>⑨</span> After thinking about her long-term goals and carefully evaluating her own abilities, starting this February, 698 sent hundreds of emails and made numerous phone calls with alumni working in finance and eventually got an internship despite the hardship.</p>
<p id="10"><span>⑩</span> 698 says that she doesn’t plan to stay in the US because she’s fundamentally Chinese. Her American culture literacy is bad and her friend circle is predominantly Chinese, which surprised me. She once joined a sorority in freshman year, but grew extremely tired of the boredom; she likes to be with those who shares value with her, which resonates with me.</p>
<p id="11"><span>⑪</span> 698 talked about the life paths of many other people: a Chinese student from UCLA student was oppressed in his/her Amazon internship, failed to get a return offer and went to CMU for grad school; another person declined a Google return offer in favor of Stanford’s PhD…</p>
<p id="12"><span>⑫</span> She says that doing tech in finance isn’t as impactful and profitable as doing tech in real tech companies (a situation that 495 might be facing now); a friend of her ended up writing websites for the company. But the growth in salary is faster than in tech.</p>
<p id="13"><span>⑬</span> I learned that lra received a Facebook offer; he didn’t announce it, but Lai-offer did. 698 commented that my abilities are well above his, but I’m not good at gathering information and learning about how to play the game.</p>
<p id="14"><span>⑭</span> On 11/19 I talked to 474. Although he and 468 are both quantum people, they seem to have different focuses: 474 is interested in quantum computing and mainly applies to CS departments, while 468 applies to physics programs. 474 says he has no idea whether he’ll get into even the “safe” schools.</p>
<p id="15"><span>⑮</span> On 11/19 night I briefly studied with 983 and 698. 983 showed me her Lyft 2020 intern Facebook group where they talk about a lot of logistics stuff, and invited me to another interesting CS Facebook group.</p>
<p id="16"><span>⑯</span> By this time, even though I’ll talk with people when studying with others or be distracted when others look at their phones, in general studying in groups can increase my efficiency, compared to 2018.</p>
<p id="17"><span>⑰</span> As I realize that I’ve wasted my CPT and OPT opportunities to gain work experience in the US, I’m now aware of a serious downside of 3 years’ graduation. As mentioned before, studying cannot be put on my resume.</p>
<p id="18"><span>⑱</span> My original thought is that if I go to work, I risk wasting several months. If I feel oppressed and bored in the job and learn nothing, like 474 did for his Amazon internship, it’d be better if I use that time to instead learn more things.</p>
