<h1>D5P183-181225</h1>
<div class="row d-flex" id="rdf" style="margin-bottom: 199px;">
<p id="p2">On 12/24, I began to have trouble getting used to the food. 12/25 I talked with Mom about my physical conditions. On 12/27 she bought a bunch of kitchen things for me to bring to the US.</p>
<p id="p3">Now on some days I still feel pretty weak and dizzy in the morning, which may or may not get better as the days go by. When that happens, I will be very vulnerable to any stimuli or pressure, and I will feel very painful if I think about my grades or future prospects, developing intense fear about my coursework, my confidence disappearing. Such was the case in about 10~15% of the days in the previous semester, and it occurred periodically.</p>
<p id="p4">I shouldn’t give myself so much pressure and was just too freaked out about things that won’t actually happen. However, last semester, the reason I still experienced that huge pressure and anxiety was more physiological than psychological, which made me much more difficult to adjust and caused a vicious cycle. If I’m very healthy, I believe I would not be depressed but will instead be very narcissistic, like in the first 3 months of 2018.</p>
<p id="p5">It’s not that my attitude and eating habits were so much better in '18 Spr. In that semester, I was also freaked out about my grades, often dreaming about crushing on exams, and I also couldn’t get enough to eat (<a href="../141/">D5P141-180508</a>: “I’ve almost never made my stomach full throughout the last semester”).</p>
<p id="p6">However, this semester, a variety of factors greatly worsened the effects of academic pressure and bad eating habits (See also: <a href="../178/">D5P178-181210</a>):</p>
<p id="p7">(1) my body quality worsened drastically beginning in July 2018, with much more frequent onsets of what seemed like low blood sugar;</p>
<p id="p8">(2) my sleep quality decreased and became more irregular;</p>
<p id="p9">(3) my pressure increased from '18 Spr, as my course load increased and I spend more time thinking about jobs;</p>
<p id="p10">(4) my social life and involvements in activities decreased by almost a third compared to '18 Spr;</p>
<p id="p11">(5) I didn’t spend as much time learning history… (My walking distance is about the same as in '18 Spr, so not doing enough sports wasn’t a contributing factor.)</p>
<p id="p12">Last semester, Vsauce, Crash Course Astronomy and Crash Course History were my biggest companions at lunch/dinner. I felt quite bad after exhausting them, so next semester I can try out some Chinese entertainment resources such as TV series or shows.</p>
<p id="p13">During the break, as I stay at the comfortable Zhenjiang home, I am gradually recovering from the final weeks and giving myself positive mental suggestions about the things I look forward in the next semester: the dances, ASB, the lunch at 2301, my friends, meeting 3b1b and Cary…</p>
<p id="p14">However, due to excessive sleeping and lying, I’ve felt quite sleepy during the day by the end of December, and my body quality declined. By 12/27 I’ve been sleeping at as late as 1 AM.</p>
<p id="p15">I read my Diary in Dec. 2016 and Jan. 2017, when I encountered similar situations—excessive sleeping caused tiredness and dizziness. Somehow, starting from Feb. 2017, I no longer complain about my body, only making occasional reference to my sleep quality.</p>
<p id="p16">Next semester, I should no longer worry much about studies and should instead focus much more on keeping my mental and physical health. Remember what I said last semester? “Often, I remind myself constantly that I should study, but I won’t actually study, which makes me kind of depressed” (<a href="../175/">D5P175-181129</a>). I’m already highly motivated, so spending that time doing effective relaxation or making dinner for myself would be a better choice!</p>
