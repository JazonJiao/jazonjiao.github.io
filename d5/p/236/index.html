<h1 id="0">D5P236-190827</h1>
<div class="row d-flex" id="rdf">
<p id="1"><span>①</span> On 8/27, I did my first mock interview with 983 on a whiteboard in FGH; we respectively solved 2 problems in a total of 80 minutes. She asked me Prob. 442, which I know the solution so I solved quickly; I then asked her Prob. 414, and she arrived at a correct solution after an initial failed attempt. She asked me Prob. 236, which I haven’t solved before and solved in 25 minutes in the second attempt. I then asked her Prob. 33, and after seeing her solution, I discussed with her how we use different ways to implement binary search.</p>
<p id="2"><span>②</span> We are both impressed by each other’s performance, and agreed that mock interview is a much better way to practice than coding by oneself. You just need to find a right partner! 983 is fluent in terms of the procedures; she always traces the algorithm on an example after finishing an algorithm.</p>
<p id="3"><span>③</span> Doing mock interviews is a pleasant experience, and now I don’t understand why I was depressed in '18 Fall. Now I’m generally pressure-free, and only feel bad when my physical conditions are bad (recently I often feel that my throat is stuck and I can hardly breathe, but it should be no big deal and I’m getting used to this feeling; my body still collapses if I eat just slightly less. Note: my stuck throat recovered by 8/31.)</p>
<p id="4"><span>④</span> Also, on 8/28 my attempted problem number reached 300. On 8/29 we met again; she asked me Prob. 402, and I asked her Prob. 581. On 8/30, she asked me Prob. 527 (which I couldn’t solve) and Prob. 254 (which I solved successfully).</p>
<p id="5"><span>⑤</span> Solving a problem by communicating my thoughts to a partner is very different from solving a problem by myself, as 983 can give me hints about whether my direction is correct or not, and this shortens the time to develop the algorithm, often drastically. Many problems can be solved really easily once you know the correct direction (such as Prob. 11 and 254), but when I’m solving it alone, I can often be stuck for hours due to a lack of hints (I really dislike expanding the “related topics” section of a problem).</p>
<p id="6"><span>⑥</span> In addition, the description and preconditions of a problem on Leetcode is sometimes confusing. When practicing with someone else, such confusions can be cleared up quickly.</p>
<p id="7"><span>⑦</span> Another advantage about asking each other problems is that to prepare for a question to ask the partner, you need to be familiar with the algorithm yourself; also, you need to pick a good problem, and doing so is an art.</p>
<p id="8"><span>⑧</span> On 9/1 night, 983 asked me Prob. 1027; later I told her my rejection at Facebook, and said it’s a warning that my job search may not turn out well. “Maybe in the end our practice will only be helping you; I’m more considering grad school now,” I said with resignation. 983 advised me to apply for internships instead of full-time.</p>
<p id="9"><span>⑨</span> On 9/2, 698 (who’s going to intern at Goldman Sachs) also said that in investment banking, even seniors apply to internships! And then they’ll either add an extra semester, or directly transfer to full-time position after the internship… Since I haven’t applied to MS and Google, I still have time to change my mind and stop applying to full-time…</p>
<p id="10"><span>⑩</span> Since 8/23, for almost the first time since I began to shuati, I began to give up on the path to software engineering and seriously consider grad school, and to treat shuati solely as a hobby. Thinking about I needing to spent another 5 years at school made me pessimistic. But now, there seems to be hope again. How volatile my future plan is!</p>
<p id="11"><span>⑪</span> On 9/3, 983 asked me Prob. 368. On 9/5 she asked me a problem from her Twitter OA, while at night I finished my Twitter OA as well.</p>
