<h1 id="0">D5P155-180821</h1>
<div class="row d-flex" id="rdf">
<p id="1"><span>①</span> In the evening of 8/17, my coughing began to dissipate as my nose became runny, but severe coughing began to set in again on 8/20—I was coughing really badly on the 14-hour flight from Shanghai to Atlanta. It took us nearly 2 hours to pass the immigration, and we almost missed our connecting flight.</p>
<p id="2"><span>②</span> Allergy reappeared on 8/18 evening, probably because of the antibiotics I ate and my declined immune system. On 8/19 the family of five ate lunch, then I and Mom left for Shanghai, met Aunt Kong and her husband, and I learned something about the cutting-edge technological trends (specifically, the importance of image processing).</p>
<p id="3"><span>③</span> My US phone number is cancelled because I stopped paying for too long, and so is many of my friends. When first arriving, things can be a bit intimidating; when this happens, my CHIA and ASB experience have been my mental refuge.</p>
<p id="4"><span>④</span> I went to CVS and bought some stuff on 8/21, but it was super expensive, and I probably misunderstood the rules for price reduction. I got an Amazon prime membership and have decided to do most of my shopping on Amazon. I’ve bought a broom, a weight scale, a rice cooker, bowls, rice, a flash drive. I got a new phone number, which is pretty easy to memorize: 6156096006.</p>
<p id="5"><span>⑤</span> I got a grader position in CS-2201, which is a little unexpected, since I just completed 2201 and am only sophomore standing. When applying, I mentioned that I got 2 94’s and 2 100’s in the four tests of 2201, and didn’t apply for grading 1101 at all since I don’t want to grade for 1101.</p>
<p id="6"><span>⑥</span> I had planned that I’ll only be grader for 2201 for a single semester, just to familiar myself more with the important concepts learned in that course. Then I’ll either grade for 3251 or work in labs or just not be a grader and instead spend more time on learning new stuff.</p>
<p id="7"><span>⑦</span> One major upshot to the grader position is that I need to seriously consider my course selection this term. Now I’ve got 5 courses: CS-2212, CS-3251, CS-2231, diff equations, and a technical writing class. Since I assume that being a grader will take up about 10 hours per week or more—equivalent to a medium-to-high-work-load course, if I add one more class, I’d be practically taking 7 courses, and the course load may exceed what I can handle.</p>
<p id="8"><span>⑧</span> I want to analyze my course load for G13F and '18 Spr. In G13F, I was very free, as the only course that’s hard was Multivariable Calc. In '18 Spr, there are two very hard courses—DL and Stats, and CS-2201 also took much time. I said I was busy and full the previous semester, studying 10 hours a day, but I also “collapsed” multiple times and was often severely interfered by my emotions. My work was “more than enough” in multiple subjects, as I got 100’s in nearly half of my mid-terms.</p>
<p id="9"><span>⑨</span> After solving 5,418 problems on Brilliant (with a correct rate of about 89%—I got 4,800+ correct) and watching tons of Math videos on YouTube including 3b1b, Infinite Series, Numberphile, and more, in the 110 days of summer vacation, my math skills are much better than the start of the previous two semesters, so I can learn things more quickly now.</p>
<p id="10"><span>⑩</span> (Speaking of Brilliant, on 8/13 I posted a short solution for the first problem of “Problem of the Week”, and got nearly 150 upvotes as 50,000+ people attempted the problem. I then updated my profile, got many followers, and was selected as a featured member.)</p>
<p id="11"><span>⑪</span> This semester, CS-2212 should take up minimum time, CS-3251 seems easier than 2201, CS-2231 should not be hard because of what I already learned in DL, and I’ve also learned most of differential equations. I don’t know how much time the writing class will take up, but it seems that, with a much calmer attitude than '18 Spr, adding a new course to my 15-hour plus grader schedule will be fine.</p>
<p id="12"><span>⑫</span> So what should I take? Machine learning? Cryptography? Graph theory? Modern algebra? I have learned the core concepts of all these fields in the summer (which is… pretty impressive). Although I got into the ML class, I actually want to take Graph theory since 488 and 139 are there. I guess there will be empty spots by the time Open Enrollment ends on 8/29.</p>
<p id="13"><span>⑬</span> Indeed, upon arriving at the school, I’ve felt a quite different mindset from when staying at home, as I’m more energized, confident, and motivated, just like the first week of '18 Spr. Actually, I was still feeling this way in May, but the motivation was gradually eroded by August, by which time I couldn’t understand what I wrote in my diary earlier this year.</p>
<p id="14"><span>⑭</span> I have summarized my “studying stages”—Stage 1, painful knowledge accumulation (“白手起家”), Jan. 8 to Apr. 12. With no experience and direction, I was actively seeking the best way to learn, and what fields I should learn. I was under much peer pressure and was easily swayed by others are doing; I couldn’t control my excessive self-expectations and would get pretty emotional when learning.</p>
<p id="15"><span>⑮</span> Stage 2, immersion, May 7 to Aug. 21. My knowledge base is large enough now; I don’t need to constantly reflect on my study strategies, and can instead think about the concepts for hours. Stage 3, cooperation, expected to start soon. I have found some like-minded friends, established my reputation at school, and have preliminarily grasped some resources through my skills.</p>
