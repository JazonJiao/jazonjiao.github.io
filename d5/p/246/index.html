<h1 id="0">D5P246-190929</h1>
<div class="row d-flex" id="rdf">
<p id="1"><span>①</span> On 9/28 night, 495 borrowed my notebook for Math 3670, and invited me to study with her, where I helped her out with her Math 3670 exercises; we eventually spent 2 hours together, and our conversation gradually got personal for the first time!</p>
<p id="2"><span>②</span> (BTW, apart from 3670, I’ve been helping people with CS 1101, 2201, 3250, 3251 as well… this takes up much of my time, but I can’t refuse them…)</p>
<p id="3"><span>③</span> When we departed at 9/29 0:50, I asked 495 why she wasn’t hanging out with 565 this semester, and she told me that they broke up calmly a few weeks ago because they are too busy to maintain the relationship.</p>
<p id="4"><span>④</span> And here comes a chance for me! In the last week, our talk frequency actually far exceeded what I’ve ever achieved with 293, but unlike with 293, I didn’t develop any emotions or think this was something special… as mentioned before, I and 495’s life goals, interests, and abilities highly overlap, so I’ll have to try!</p>
<p id="5"><span>⑤</span> Also, in the last 1 month I’ve been spending significant time (~30 min each day) watching CatLive videos on Bilibili, and the girl host (3cat) is from Chengdu, with a similar accent to 495’s, so I feel like I talk more like a Chengdu person now…</p>
<p id="6"><span>⑥</span> On 10/1, I studied with 469 for a night. 469 is attending 6 on-site interviews in this semester, so she has to fly to California frequently and miss on average 1 ~ 2 days of classes every week! I also smoked her e-cigarette (and choked when first tried…) she says she uses it occasionally to keep her awake.</p>
<p id="7"><span>⑦</span> From 10/2 to 10/4, 495 attended Grace Hopper at Orlando. She doesn’t like SWE positions and instead applied to data scientists at big techs, although this is really hard without a MS or PhD. Despite the low odds of job applications, she got a lot of fee waivers for grad school application, which can sum up to $1,000!! Ah!</p>
<p id="8"><span>⑧</span> 495 later told me that an Apple recruiter asked her 2 questions, one about regular expressions and the other about Linux—neither she or I can answer either—and then criticized her for “not studying enough”… Indeed, these questions require such an extensive knowledge base that it’s hard to get through them without a higher degree or much industry experience.</p>
<p id="9"><span>⑨</span> By 10/8, 495 still frequently messages me and ask me questions; when I help her out, we can talk for a pretty long time. When I ask her for help, though, she most likely doesn’t know and our talk ends quickly, so things get a little awkward. Combined with the fact that we still seldom talk about non-academic stuff, these scenarios sort of reminds me of my conversations with 979 (<a href="../192/">D5P192</a>)…</p>
<p id="10"><span>⑩</span> Meanwhile, I and 293 have also been talking every day, and our topics are almost entirely personal. On 10/6, 293 invited me to take the 16-personality test—she’s an INTP! However, when I took the test, I ended up INFJ instead of INTP (I’ve always Identified myself as INTP). I think my answer to many questions can vary a lot at different times of my life.</p>
<p id="11"><span>⑪</span> On 10/8, I saw 139 making a video call with his girlfriend, during which they just waved at each other incessantly without saying much. This is kind of funny, but I can feel how uplifting it can be to one’s psychology. In the long journey of PhD, should I seek for such kind of “boring” but super supportive relationship, or a more comradeship-based companionship where we fight on the same front?</p>
<p id="12"><span>⑫</span> I now know of 2 of my peers having a girlfriend from one grade above, but my long-time dream of finding an upper-class girlfriend seems to have died on 8/23…</p>
<p id="13"><span>⑬</span> Back when I still liked 493, setting her as my goal provided a concrete, consistent source of motivation for me. In the 1.5 months since I declared that I stopped liking her, I lost a powerful source of motivation, and my self-control decreased a lot.</p>
<p id="14"><span>⑭</span> I look at my summer Diaries where I was not at all anxious and was super determined to chase 493. I think if I can resume my feelings for 493, it can solve many of my attitude problems. I won’t be afraid to ask 495 or 293 out, and my self-control will improve greatly as I don’t have imminent coursework after this wave of mid-terms are over—otherwise I’ll find myself wandering on the internet every day.</p>
