<div class="row d-flex" id="rdf">
<p id="1"><span>①</span> ISD Assignment 4, one of the hardest of all assignments, is due 3/13. About 16 Chinese students in our grade are taking this class now, with 7 girls and 9 boys—and I’m obviously the first person to seek to when they need help. Since 3/8, I’ve been bombarded with questions by those struggling classmates, especially 698, who I spend more than an hour talking to each day.</p>
<p id="2"><span>②</span> On 3/12 noon I accidentally watched a new video by Coffee Break. At first the comments were overwhelmingly against Kurzgesagt. Their “Can You Trust Kurzgesagt” video was filled with comments about disappointment and redirecting people to Coffee Break’s video.</p>
<p id="3"><span>③</span> Then, the like-dislike ratio was like 5:1, and I was one of the “1.” I felt kind of weird about his arguments, but was swayed by public opinion. After I held an intense office hour, by evening, the tides turned with literally dramatic speed! The like-dislike ratio plummeted to 2:1, later reaching 1:1. Coffee Break is now largely discredited, and I learned a lot from this drama. My affection towards Kurzgesagt increased to a new level.</p>
<p id="4"><span>④</span> On 3/12 at 23:30 I posted my first Moment since basically the last ASB. I spent about 10 hours preparing for it and have been thinking about it since last month. The post’s popularity was unexpected, and it eventually got over 100 likes. (the number is 39 from 982’s point of view.)</p>
<p id="5"><span>⑤</span> On 3/14 afternoon, I was immersed in writing the script for ELR Chapter 4. My flow of thoughts was suddenly interrupted when 493 sent me a happy birthday.</p>
<p id="6"><span>⑥</span> Previously I was kind of sad that none of 493, 481, and 488 liked my post, so her message is very surprising. The “dream” that I mentioned in my WeChat Moments post largely refers to catch up on 493 as I mentioned in the last letter to her, as I don’t really have a super clear-cut dream right now.</p>
<p id="7"><span>⑦</span> I later had a good talk to her during my office hours. I told her my decision to graduate early for the first time—a scene I’ve imagined since over a year ago, and her first reaction is to compliment on me. Oh, you can never imagine how much that encouragement means to me…</p>
<p id="8"><span>⑧</span> Since 2/5, I’ve kind of “lost my feeling,” and my motivation and emotion have been consistently low. Hopefully this is, like April and Sept 2018, just a small cycle of recession, and that my motivations will spontaneously restore later…</p>
<p id="9"><span>⑨</span> On 3/13 I missed a Google event that I previously signed up for. On 3/14 evening 863 invited 13 other people to dinner (AA) at the Chinese Noodle restaurant. We later had a very intellectual talk about our respective life paths.</p>
<p id="10"><span>⑩</span> On 3/15, 671 and I organized a birthday party at the same place as yesterday’s 863 party. We’ve been preparing for five days. Since 617 invited tons of girls and there are only 15 spots, I could invite fewer people: 139, 982, 026 (who happens to be born on 3/15), 329, and later 133. It was quite a difficult decision for me. I’m feeling bad especially for my NFLS friends who invited me previously, such as 544, 545, 309, and 355. As with on 309’s birthday, we played truth or dare, and 671 was asked about her emotional status, but she avoided answering it…</p>
<p id="11"><span>⑪</span> On 3/11 we had our second mid-term for Math-3890. I was misled by the first exam and thought no homework questions will be on the exam, so I spent much time reviewing materials that I thought was more challenging. As a result, I got all points on the most difficult problem, but lost 13 points on two really simple problems that come directly from our homework.</p>
<p id="12"><span>⑫</span> My grade was 80 (later corrected to 84), which jeopardizes my hope of getting an A, because the test accounts for 25% of the grade (I lost 4%). Class average was about 83.</p>
<p id="13"><span>⑬</span> Now that I got only average scores on two consecutive Math/CS tests (I had 29 Math/CS tests/quizzes last semester, but only 6 non-take-home tests this semester), my state has reached a trough since college life. I’ve been reflecting extensively on my studying strategy.</p>
