<h1 id="0">D5P275-191226</h1>
<div class="row d-flex" id="rdf">
<p id="1"><span>①</span> On 12/26 I met with 925, who studies at UPenn (so do 219 and 926), entered Google’s EPI program (I first knew of this program in <a href="../163/">D5P163</a>), and has received a return offer.</p>
<p id="2"><span>②</span> We met for 2 hours at Deji Plaza at lunch. Contrary to my perception, 925 didn’t do any CS in high school (she got in to UPenn as a material science major), and only switched to CS in spring 2018. When she applied to EPI, she received two consecutive phone interviews, as did 983. She said the problems were pretty easy.</p>
<p id="3"><span>③</span> At Google, 925 has a manager whom she reports to weekly, and a mentor. The work is in general low-stress. The first week was orientation for Nooglers. 925 writes C++ code (with some Google-specific addons) and works on improving a product. She usually eats alone at lunch and often just stays at home at night. Next time I apply to Google, I can ask 925 to refer me!</p>
<p id="4"><span>④</span> UPenn apparently has stricter graduation requirements for math and CS majors, and 925 says that many people graduate in more than 4 years. She’s taking Algebra next semester as a requisite; I don’t need Algebra class for applied math major.</p>
<p id="5"><span>⑤</span> Because of Wharton, many UPenn students choose to double major in an Engineering subject plus a field of business. Two of 925’s 2nd-year roommates entered JPMorgan and GS respectively. However, she doesn’t even know what 926 studies...</p>
<p id="6"><span>⑥</span> On 12/27 I and 922 met for lunch; by then, I hadn’t seen her—my erstwhile desk-mate and best friend—for over 5 years. 922 is super talkative; many times, just as I was going to talk, she began to talk instead. I remember a time in Grade 9 when she was unhappy and antisocial, but now she has become a “standard good friend”—people like to talk to her since she replies instantly whenever possible.</p>
<p id="7"><span>⑦</span> I finally knew why 922 failed Zhongkao—she only got a score of 60s in Chinese (I got 102) because her essay title was incorrect! She only became aware of this after her family somehow found people to look into her test. During her years at NFLS Xianlin Campus, she didn’t go to classes and instead studied at home, only attending finals (where she always got first in the grade). Students at Xianlin are so dumb, she said.</p>
<p id="8"><span>⑧</span> 922 studies Math + CS at Emory and participates in a 3+2 program with GT where she’ll earn another bachelor’s degree in Industrial Engineering; getting degrees from 2 schools can give her an advantage when seeking jobs.</p>
<p id="9"><span>⑨</span> I commented that I and her are the same type of people in that we like to study and don’t tend to care about the “rules of the game”, and told her much about how the grad school application game works.</p>
<p id="10"><span>⑩</span> 922 interned at JPMorgan in HK (she disliked the job much and was bothered by a girl she worked with who said bad things about her); she comments that 90% of her peers who got into banks relied on their parents’ power. Even WST will just teach you how to utilize your parents’ connections.</p>
<p id="11"><span>⑪</span> 922 has lives out of campus and drives to school. She talked about a boy she calls “iron tree” who’s chasing her by asking her questions, and it’s super amusing!</p>
