<p id="1"><span>①</span> On 10/25, I went to Atlanta and was greeted by 287. It’s amazing to explore life at another college in depth. GT campus is so big that the break is 15 minutes long. While Vandy emphasized meeting new people when we first came, GT has many students coming from the same high school so there are pre-formed friend circles.</p>
<p id="2"><span>②</span> I contacted 922, 955, and 227, but none of them have time to meet me. So I just studied GRE on GT campus.</p>
<p id="3"><span>③</span> On the bus back, amid the beautiful autumn scenery, I began to think deeply about life. How did I achieve the confident state in '18 Spr? Back in 2017, I spent 1,000 hours reflecting on my past. I analyzed my studying trend using the perspective inspired by reading history; I looked at the studying methods from a psychological lens.</p>
<p id="4"><span>④</span> Thinking about the “three humiliations” in my NFLS time: the 5/3, the 1/7, the 12/12, gave me a tremendous amount of motivation (a faith that “I have nothing right now, so I don’t deserve complaining about anything”) but also made me afraid of CS. Of course, the sources of motivation described so far are based on reflecting on my past. Recently, exploring my future path has offered me another source of motivation.</p>
<p id="5"><span>⑤</span> At the time, I made a rule for myself to learn humanities at least 15% of my studying time to keep myself motivated. The purpose of reading history is to keep my outlook big. In some sense, this kind of reflection counts towards that 15% as well.</p>
<p id="6"><span>⑥</span> I think I wouldn’t be in this optimistic frame of mind on campus; the gorgeous views are a great inspiration for my personal reflection. That’s exactly what I hope to achieve in the out-of-town trip. A change in environment can be a great way to adjust my attitude.</p>
<p id="7"><span>⑦</span> On 10/26 night, I finished the online assessment from Optiver, a trading firm that contacted me through Piazza. The test didn’t involve any coding, and I’m unfamiliar with many of the concepts. 495 accompanied me through the test, but wasn’t able to help.</p>
<p id="8"><span>⑧</span> I later helped her review some CS concepts—I answered the coding problems she asked me instantly, without even thinking. I’ll just quietly wish her good luck for 10/28, as she doesn’t want to be disturbed…</p>
