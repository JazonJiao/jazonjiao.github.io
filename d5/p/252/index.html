<div class="row d-flex" id="rdf">
<p id="1"><span>①</span> On 10/16 night, 495 and I met up for 2 hours and struggled on AI Project 2 together. This project is weird, since a lot of times you just try randomly until you stumble upon a correct solution that passes the tests.</p>
<p id="2"><span>②</span> I talked a ton about my recent explosion when preparing for grad school—as I contact recommenders, I basically need to have prepared all my materials. 495 says that she doesn’t know of other people applying to ML programs besides me and her.</p>
<p id="3"><span>③</span> So 495 seems to be my biggest competition now; she has a gender advantage, while I have advantages in GPA and hopefully all other aspects of applications: rec, research, SoP, and GRE (I plan to take it again in November, but seems that I will have less time to prepare than I expected…).</p>
<p id="4"><span>④</span> Thankfully, my other greatest competitor, 488, is going to FB. (Note: on 10/22, 476 told me he’s applying to grad school as well. Heck, will he be another competitor for me?)</p>
<p id="5"><span>⑤</span> From 10/13 to 10/17, apart from spending about 5 to 6 hours on coursework each day, I spend an additional 5 to 6 hours on various components of the application, but I feel much less exhausted compared to when I was grinding Math 3320 concepts.</p>
<p id="6"><span>⑥</span> These days I need to write a ton of things, so my extensive English-writing practice in my Diary becomes really helpful. On 10/16 I spent about 500 RMB for access to all recourses in 1-point-3-acres, and looked at results from previous applicants.</p>
<p id="7"><span>⑦</span> I am now grateful for not being accepted for SWE positions, since preparing for grad school has forced me to explore my future goals, reflect deeply on my summer research, and get to know dashens in AI and ML. My impression on SWE decreased dramatically as I find ML more interesting and ML skills more irreplaceable.</p>
<p id="8"><span>⑧</span> On 10/17, I and 495 gathered again for the AI project, and we studied and talked for 7 hours. 495 is apparently more interested in finance than ML. I encouraged her and said that I’ll have one fewer competitor for ML if she gets a finance offer (although it’s really hard).</p>
<p id="9"><span>⑨</span> 495 looked really nice on 10/17; when we headed back, I commented that when she doesn’t wear glasses, she looks several times more beautiful than when she does (her glasses are expensive and are supposed to protect her eyes from screen radiations), and she says she doesn’t want to look too good since boys will chase her…</p>
<p id="10"><span>⑩</span> During our 7 hours together, 495 is also quite focused when studying, as mentioned before, and this increases my focus as well. However, she seems very perfectionist.</p>
<p id="11"><span>⑪</span> On 10/18 I ate dinner with 120, and 545 and 355. I really miss the time when 545 would invite me and other NFLSers to dumplings and poker games. But since sophomore year, I haven’t seen 545 and 355 much. I later visited their dorm.</p>
<p id="12"><span>⑫</span> I grew depressed on 10/18 due to the anxiety from communicating with profs about recs, so I spent some time walking around campus and resting. Since 10/19, I resumed studying 10+ hours each day.</p>
<p id="13"><span>⑬</span> On 10/20 I had a very productive time studying with 495 from 13:20 to 23:10. 495 seems pretty stressful; she frequently frowns and often pulls off a strand of hair. My feelings for 495 is still rather weak, but it’s a good thing, since I know that if it’s 293 who’s sitting in front of me, my efficiency will decline by at least 75% when studying.</p>
<p id="14"><span>⑭</span> On 10/22 after the AI class, as I studied with 495 in Kissam, I suddenly recalled that I this was the exact date when I began to like 493. I told 495 about how I ferociously liked 493 two years back, sent her 2 love letters, graduate a year early because of her, Leetcode-d crazily during summer, until my feelings dissolved recently because of no hope catching up on her. (P.S. when first I said I liked an upper-class girl, 495’s first reaction was 475 and then 469??)</p>
<p id="15"><span>⑮</span> After that, I asked 495 if I can chase her, and then immediately added a “no I’m just kidding” out of caution. 495 didn’t reply directly, instead saying she’s in a mess recently and that she likes someone else. Still, we two studied for an entire night for a total of 7.5 hours (adding up to 26 hours in the past 7 days), and she invited me to study again tomorrow.</p>
<p id="16"><span>⑯</span> Since 495 is fairly busy, studying with her significantly boosts my efficiency—I studied almost nonstop while with her. She keeps her phone face down behind the laptop most of the time, so I do the same.</p>
