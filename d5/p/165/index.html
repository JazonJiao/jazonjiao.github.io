<div class="row d-flex" id="rdf" style="margin-bottom: 199px;">
<p id="1"><span>①</span> On 10/17~19, I implemented Sudoku and 2048 in my C++ Mini Games project, since I wrote about them in my Google essay but haven’t really worked on them as of then. Also, I have nothing much to do in the fall break otherwise.</p>
<p id="2"><span>②</span> I also added more functionalities to my previous games, but this is very error-prone, and I’m exploring how to make my programs more maintainable in the long run.</p>
<p id="3"><span>③</span> On 10/20 night I signed up for VandyHacks with 983 and 120; later 982 joined as well. Our team name is “Brilliant”—speaking of brilliant(.org), my problem-solving streak stopped at 128 days as I solved 6714 problems…</p>
<p id="4"><span>④</span> On 10/19 I forgot to completely seal the lid when cooking my porridge, which almost caused an accident… at night 545 invited me to dinner, and we played pokers together, which is kind of boring. A really big problem is, I don’t know how I should pay them for this dinner…</p>
<p id="5"><span>⑤</span> Speaking of which, 329 has ordered many meals together with me this month. In return, I have helped him a lot in CS-2201, though he’ still not doing super good at it…</p>
<p id="6"><span>⑥</span> 329 has been ordering off-campus meals since freshman year, and still orders dinner frequently now since he can’t get used to the food on campus. That’s a lot of money to spend, but he later revealed the staggering wealth of his family. Anyway, since 329 cares about me a lot, I have also doubted how I should pay back the favors.</p>
<p id="7"><span>⑦</span> As many of my previous mentors—Liyi, 3b1b—have stopped updating, I’m trying to find new mentors to look up to. By now, there are three people in my grade that have served as my role model: 982, 026, and 983. They happen to be the only known GPA-4.0 Chinese students in our grade.</p>
<p id="8"><span>⑧</span> What’s different this time is that I’m good friends with these mentors, and they admire me as well as my ability is only second to theirs. When in doubt, set them as my goal and work hard!</p>
<p id="9"><span>⑨</span> I’m still eagerly waiting for Google’s response; Gwen said that someone applying to Microsoft’s equivalent program heard back after only two days since he applied so early. I still applied too late for this opportunity that can change the course of my life…</p>
<p id="10"><span>⑩</span> On 10/21 I did some more job search and am actually pretty impressed by Khan Academy’s position. It’s a young, vibrant, high-learning-curve environment where I can constantly learn new things and attend fun events to expand my outlook. And I actually really enjoy teaching stuff (especially online)!</p>
<p id="11"><span>⑪</span> Staying on campus in a small town for too long, the relatively dull life has really eroded my motivation somewhat, as there are few exciting things and few opportunities where I can take initiative (events such as Rainbow Academy and Xi’an PanoFair)—I’m predominantly “passive” in the events I attend now.</p>
<p id="12"><span>⑫</span> That is one reason I don’t want to go to grad school—another being the effortful process of choosing a professor and explaining why I like this field.</p>
<p id="13"><span>⑬</span> Next semester I probably won’t be TA for CS-2201; as I expect my work load to decrease in the later half of the semester, I want to spend more time cracking CS-3251 and learning C++, aiming for a TA position next semester.</p>
<p id="14"><span>⑭</span> Originally, I wanted to be a grader for Math-3670, but by now I’ve been devoting most of my time on software instead of data science. I’ve realized the path of software engineer might not be the best choice in the long run, but now I’m just so eager to get into a big tech company in the first place.</p>
