<h1 id="0">D5P78-170829</h1>
<div class="row d-flex" id="rdf">
<p id="1"><span>①</span> On 8/29 I opened a bank account. By 8/29 my sleep quality is still unimproved and I’m still unable to concentrate in the afternoon. I tried lying on bed for 10 min, but then it takes only a short time before sleepiness arouse again.</p>
<p id="2"><span>②</span> Then I tried drinking RedBull to stimulate myself for the first time in life, and but to little avail; to find out its effects, I may need to collect more historical data.</p>
<p id="3"><span>③</span> Historically, I have consumed coffee only during Zhongkao Prep, but it actually had little effects on my sleep and level of excitement. (PS: That night I couldn’t fall asleep until 2 AM, and I attributed this to RedBull.)</p>
<p id="4"><span>④</span> Another potential benefit of drinking energy drinks is on attitude, as they may give me a sense of urgency: “The effect of the drink is going to dissipate in several hours, so I have to utilize this time to study more!”</p>
<p id="5"><span>⑤</span> It was not until I slept for 45 minutes in late afternoon that I regained some focus. After that I was pretty anxious because my learning efficiency was extremely low in the afternoon, but I tried to control my emotions because I knew the devastating effects of anxiety attacks. I actively recalled the situations on the 12/12, the 2/19, the May Prep, 9/6/2016.</p>
<p id="6"><span>⑥</span> On 8/30 night I tried out working out at about 11 PM at Commons for 30 minutes and then have a bath, because having bath 1 hr before sleep can bolster sleep quality, and bathing at night instead of morning might be better (now I bath in morning).</p>
<p id="7"><span>⑦</span> While running I watched Khan Academy on multivariable calculus on my iPhone, but my hand hit my earphone wire and my phone fell off the treadmill, and I tried to pick up the phone but fell off the rapidly-moving treadmill and scratched my right leg.</p>
<p id="8"><span>⑧</span> This reminds me of how dangerous those equipment can be if care is not taken, and I’m reconsidering watching videos when running… Sad.</p>
<p id="9"><span>⑨</span> On 9/1 night I attended a dumpling feast and sang Viva La Vida after Vincent prompted me to do so, and joined VUCA (the only club I joined as of now); on 9/2 I attended interNASHional, sampled food from many countries, and talked with an Persian guy; on 9/2 night I, 9 other NFLS 2021ers, yzn, and 7 NFLS 2020ers went to a Chinese restaurant; on 9/3 noon I attended VUCSSA’s activity of “BBQ”.</p>
<p id="10"><span>⑩</span> This weekend is full of various activities, but this is what makes me empty except meeting a few new friends and gaining some information from others.</p>
<p id="11"><span>⑪</span> For example: 1st year residence is really favorable compared to upperclassmen’s; they used to play wolfers from 0 to 4 AM at weekends just to have fun; in Iran people are pro-Western and they blame government for being anti-Western; there are actually many foreigners interested in Chinese culture, though many students in my History class are Chinese…</p>
<p id="12"><span>⑫</span> Although after these events my “sense of urgency to study” strengthened (this reminds me of Zhongkao Prep’s “Least motivated on Friday, regain impetus after playing at weekends”), when I actually begin to study, I had a more difficult time trying to re-immerse into it.</p>
<p id="13"><span>⑬</span> Alas, should I really turn down these activities in the future? And just stay in the library alone at weekends? As I said, gaining extra friends doesn’t seem to be very useful now.</p>
<p id="14"><span>⑭</span> By now I’m still struggling with a better sleep cycle. Sleeping excessively will make me sleepy (if I wake up during “REM” then sleepy in afternoon, if I wake up during deep sleep then sleepy in morning), and so is insufficient sleeping.</p>
<p id="15"><span>⑮</span> I now keep track of my sleeping time to make better decisions on how much I should sleep in a particular day, based on the sleeping conditions on previous days.</p>
<p id="16"><span>⑯</span> I also want to keep track of my studying time, but the problem is that it is pretty hard to define. Sometimes I am looking at the material but I ain’t learning a thing; yet sometimes I am so immersed that after a period of studying ends, I am still thinking actively about the knowledge.</p>
<p id="17"><span>⑰</span> Added on 9/5: Today I attended an interesting psychology experiment, and at the Visions Meeting on 9/4 we attended an activity called “Claim Common Ground”, which are interesting.</p>
<p id="18"><span>⑱</span> Since recovery from the scratch by the treadmill, from 9/3 on I’ve gradually begun to keep the daily exercise, sometimes in Commons, where I run while watching Maths on Khan Academy, and sometimes at the Rec, where I ride on a fancy bicycle-stimulator machine.</p>
<p id="19"><span>⑲</span> By now the benefits of recording my sleep time has emerged. By evaluating my sleep hours on previous days, I can determine whether my sleep at one day is enough.</p>
<p id="20"><span>⑳</span> If not, then I will go to sleep when I’m really sleepy in the day, like I did in much of last week. If it is enough, then I’ll lay on the desk for some time at most.</p>
<p id="21"><span>㉑</span> My social life has progressed slowly because I really have nothing valuable to talk about with others. I don’t like walking with someone else because I like walking fast and even running, and I don’t even force myself to socialize during meals but instead watch Khan Academy (although my efficiency of watching it declined due to increased numbness).</p>
<p id="22"><span>㉒</span> But studying together might be a good idea from time to time, and so is working out together at the Rec. I’ll try to adjust in the upcoming days.</p>
<p id="23"><span>㉓</span> The course load seems lower than I expected, although many Americans complain about lack of sleep and too much homework. I have almost 4 whole days every week in which I can study for more than 10 hours, and adding the 7 hours on MWF, it turns out to be so much that I don’t seem to know how to deal with the extra time. After all, ES and HIST are both under-100-hr courses, and others combined require at most 25 hours per week.</p>
