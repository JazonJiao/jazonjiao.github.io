<div class="row d-flex" id="rdf">
<p id="1"><span>①</span> On 11/20, after the super difficult and strange 2nd Math 3320 test—where everyone exploded—I worked my a__ off for 6 hours to (secretly) complete our AI group project on my own, which 495 originally planned to finish on 11/21 night with me and 468. I did this since 11/21 was the final chance to audition for an LNYF dance (I had invited her to several auditions but she didn’t have time); and meanwhile I needed to prepare for the AI quiz since 495 will ask me questions.</p>
<p id="2"><span>②</span> Chasing her, once again, boils down to more studying… Last week when I was free, I once told her I can help her with a data science assignment, and I quickly solved 2 problems even without my 3670 class notes (I gave the notes to her on 9/28). Whenever we study together, I can reflexively concentrate better.</p>
<p id="3"><span>③</span> The project was about understanding the AlphaZero game-playing reinforcement learning algorithm, and I learned a lot about AI as I read the paper and answered the questions.</p>
<p id="4"><span>④</span> 495 was surprised and impressed by my work, and praised me as “Dr. Jiao.” After our 4th AI quiz, on 11/21 night, I justifiably invited her to the Tinikling clinic/audition, and we danced in pair and talked for about 2 hours. Apart from the three Script Kill games during the summer, this is the first time that I hang out with her for non-coursework purposes.</p>
<p id="5"><span>⑤</span> Although I attended Tinikling this year, it was still hard for me to learn the moves. On the other hand, 495 danced even better than I did! Since we talked for so long on that day, there would occasionally be times when we run out of topics and both of us fall into silence, and that feels a bit awkward for me.</p>
<p id="6"><span>⑥</span> Now, I still have no idea whether 495 likes me or not. Even though the frequency that she contacts me on WeChat has exceeded what I’ve ever encountered before, when we meet in person, I don’t feel that she treats me specially.</p>
<p id="7"><span>⑦</span> Actually, I sort of don’t know whether I like 495, either. Last weekend (11/16) when she asked me to send my 3620 homework to her, I actually felt quite annoyed since her attitudes weren’t good. But she was in a significantly better mood when she asked me questions on 11/23, since we’ve just started a 9-day break.</p>
<p id="8"><span>⑧</span> Our connection is predominantly driven by academics and careers, and a more personal connection has been slow to build up. Also, she seldom makes herself up when meeting with me, and almost always wears the same black from head to toe, and this affects my feelings for her as well. If only she dresses more nicely!</p>
