<div class="row d-flex" id="rdf" style="margin-bottom: 199px;">
<p id="p2">On 3/2 the 12-people crew flew to Boston, rented a car, and started our ASB trip in New Hampshire. The two site leaders, Francesca and Mine, did their life maps. Francesca is a special-ed major and she talked about how she grew interested in education. Mine (read: mee-nay) is a Turkish citizen who speaks English so fluently that she’s indistinguishable from any American. She laughs a lot, which makes her really likable and I should learn from that.</p>
<p id="p3">On 3/3 we had a road trip, and the scenery along the road is just super. Roger and Justin did their life maps. Roger is an ABC who’s also a choreographer for Soran Bushi. One thing he talked about that I found interesting was how his good grades helped him attract lots of friends in high school: “If you’re smart, you’re popular.” He talked about how “smartness” is a central part of his identity among his circle, and I feel a strong resonance.</p>
<p id="p4">Justin talked about some funny things. He talked a lot about his friends and emphasize how they are important in his self-care. Indeed, these life maps remind me of the importance of friends again. When I am reflecting on my personal experiences, I don’t think about my friends much, neither their influence on me. I’ve been a quite self-centered person, and few of my guy friends have had a life-changing influence on me:</p>
<p id="p5">Also, like last time, many people in my group are pre-med, and they talk much about it. Roger has been doing bio stuff since high school and already applied to many schools. Justin plans to take a gap year to do research and then apply to grad school.</p>
<p id="p6">I also learned some new expressions like “burn out”, “burn the bridges”, “pro”, “buzzword”, and better expressions like “survive a semester”, “reinvent myself”, “that became my thing”.</p>
<p id="p7">On 3/4 it’s our first day of service. On my name tag my name is misspelled as “Jaxon”, which I think isn’t a bad name. In the morning there’s a blizzard and the snow is now about 25 cm deep. I and Owuraku (that sounds like Japanese but he’s a black guy from Ghana) worked on the farm. After school our teacher took us on a tour around Crotched Mountain, and I was so struck by the beautiful views along the way that I almost cried—that’s the happiest moment I had in a long time!</p>
<p id="p8">Tonight Maggie and Caroline’s did her Life Maps. Maggie told many fun stories without talking about her academics at all. She talked about the role of Christianity: she lost faith in God after a family tragedy, but changed her mind under the influence of her boyfriend. She also does martial arts (and almost chose to train for Karate at 2020 Tokyo), and so does her boyfriend, and their first contact was fighting each other in a Visions group meeting... She may take 2 gap years before applying to med school??!</p>
<p id="p9">Caroline, though, talked a lot about her life path, success, getting good grades, working hard since her parents are paying for the tuition. She took the IB path, and it seems to be much harder than AP. By now Mine, Roger and Caroline all focused much of their life maps on studies, while the other people told fun stories. I really like this academic-oriented environment!</p>
<p id="p10">On 3/5 night we were invited by a Vandy alumni for dinner. Her house is 40 minutes’ drive away from our site and located in the middle of a forest, like many other houses here. Their house is very beautifully decorated, and they say it’s very cheap—get closer to Boston and house prices rise exponentially. The couple is married in 2001 and now have two boys.</p>
<p id="p11">Then George and Owuraku did their life maps. George’s is the shortest I’ve heard, as he only talked for less than 40 minutes. He almost moved back to China but didn’t, since his father accidentally landed in a new job in New Jersey.</p>
<p id="p12">Owuraku is quite hilarious and has been routinely asking questions like “if you could have a superpower what would it be” after others’ life maps. He talks about how one of his testicles was “missing” but then was magically found, and everyone laughed so hard that some of us fell on the ground... He also talks about how his mother is “yellow” or even “orange” (??) since her father is German, but from the picture she’s apparently pretty black... Owuraku frequently mentions how he hates studies, but he has learned five languages. Now he’s learning Chinese since he’s a civil engineer and back in Ghana, many construction site managers are Chinese.</p>
<p id="p13">On 3/5 night I caught a little frostnip on both of my feet, and they felt numb for three or four days before recovering on 3/10. It felt somewhat itchy after that.</p>
<p id="p14">On 3/6 Courtney and Judy did their life maps. Courtney’s is even shorter than George’s... she’s been the most quiet and inactive person on our site, and her voice is super low. She has been introverted since she’s young, and so is her father, hence they two are close.</p>
<p id="p15">Judy is the only person I knew before ASB, as she’s also in Tinikling. Her life map focused much on her piano career, where she’s got a state champion and performed in front of thousands of people. She grew up in an Asian community in Atlanta and liked to hang out with Koreans. Her parents are both Shanghainese; her father didn’t attend more than elementary school, but somehow eventually got into Fujian University in his 20’s, went to Berkeley for his master’s degree but had to suspend for some time to make money.</p>
<p id="p16">Judy was also accepted at Cornell but didn’t go because it’s too far. A ton of her friends ended up in Ivy. She has vlogs at YouTube and Tumblr, and after her life map 8 people in our group subscribed to her YouTube channel. Her favorite class is organic chemistry since she thinks it’s creative and artistic.</p>
<p id="p17">On 3/7 night I and Emily did our life maps. Emily mainly talked about her family stories; I wasn’t interested in that, so since she’s the first Jew I know of, I asked her whether she knows Hebrew and what Jewish culture is like. Her father emphasized the Jewish heritage and celebrated some Jewish festivals instead of Christmas, but Emily isn’t super interested in it and forgot what little Hebrew she learned.</p>
<p id="p18">On 3/8 night we did a closing ceremony that lasted more than 3 hours. The setup was similar to the last ASB. Everyone took turns to comment on each of the other team member, so there are 11 squared, i.e. 121 rounds of comments. We went home on 3/9.</p>
<p id="p19">On 3/12 night, Roger organized a little birthday party for me, where people came to his suite and just chatted around. Mine baked a cake for me with brownies and Oreos—it was really tasty and I super appreciate it! I later went to play volleyball with Roger.</p>
