<div class="row d-flex" id="rdf">
<p id="1"><span>①</span> On 7/4 I watched the firework show from 982’s house. On 7/6 afternoon the CHIA group toured the Frist Art Museum. 982 once proposed a trip to Minneapolis, and it did not eventually realize. But my social needs (and emotional needs) have declined drastically recently, since I’m spending a significant amount of time watching TV series like In the Name of People, which have almost subverted my worldview!</p>
<p id="2"><span>②</span> On 7/3 night, before I started to solve a new Leetcode problem, I looked at 493’s WeChat page and found her updated background picture… (In fact, I have been frequently keeping track of her social media page.) At the moment, I didn’t feel too sad, as this has been what I have expected. I just felt that my motivation suddenly collapsed. What do I work so hard for? Well, for a large part, her!</p>
<p id="3"><span>③</span> I have so much emotion in my mind, so much to say, but I can’t say anything about this to anyone really. Except my dear Diary. I look at my friends’ WeChat pages. Many of them have found beautiful girls/boys and playing happily around the world. I feel so bad that I am still fighting alone in a dull city, although I have a few really good friends.</p>
<p id="4"><span>④</span> It’s interesting how, in the 3 years after the 5/0 Incident, my mentality for finding a girlfriend went from “growing together” to “catching up on her,” and now transitioning towards “have fun together.” This transition is natural, since I was eager to excel in college back in 2017, but now I’m a bit tired fighting, and my emphasis on my partner’s academic superiority seems to be dissipating.</p>
<p id="5"><span>⑤</span> At this point, my desire to get back to social media like in spring 2015, and to “fall in love” like in summer 2017, might have reached a critical point. But deep down I know that right now, I should not be swayed by others’ colorful life, as others’ social media pages often hide their difficulties in life. For example, 2 of my friends have been complaining to me how bad their work is.</p>
<p id="6"><span>⑥</span> Additionally, although I don’t travel around the world, my worldview and quality are still expanding as I watch historical articles, movies, and TV series, and reflect deeply on my own life, just like I watched tons of Vsauce and CC Astronomy in '18 Fall (btw, I haven’t opened YouTube for I guess a month now). I wish I can achieve the literacy of, say, 982 or Wang Diudiu, so that I can express myself better with the pictures I would post.</p>
<p id="7"><span>⑦</span> Finally, I believe my academic progress is among the fastest among my peers. In just 21 months, I have enhanced my Math and CS skills dramatically, and I should be proud of myself.</p>
<p id="8"><span>⑧</span> I have lost so much in my middle school life and I need to make up for that in those 3 or 4 years of college. Just another one or two years!</p>
