<div class="row d-flex" id="rdf">
<p id="1"><span>①</span> Tonight 7 of my NFLSer peers at Vandy, along with our respective parents, went to dinner together. 413, 309, and 544 are staying in the US. Dad taught me how to order food.</p>
<p id="2"><span>②</span> When I met 619, she told me that she knew who I was talking about on 11/18. I asked her how she knew it, and she said that C, a Class of 2020 xuejie, told her. “It’s just too obvious, she said.”</p>
<p id="3"><span>③</span> I know C from her presence in our WeChat group, but haven’t even met her, and she shouldn’t have recognized me; how on earth did she know about me and 493? Reminded of an unpleasant experience, for half an hour after that I was in a depressed mood.</p>
<p id="4"><span>④</span> At the table, as part of the procedure designed by the parents, we first talked about how we have grown in the past semester. As the first speaker, I talked mainly about how I enjoyed the good academic environment and enhanced my study skills, but when I mentioned that I got A’s in 2/3 of my courses, 545 and other girls’ first reaction was that I shouldn’t have said that.</p>
<p id="5"><span>⑤</span> I immediately apologized, and realized that girls don’t like mentioning grades and stuff, just as what 457 showed during our lunch on 2016/2/19. I was not “wrong” telling others my grades, though. After all, 496 had posted her 4.0 GPA explicitly on her WeChat Moments... anyway, this reminds me that I should best avoid “showing off” my grades.</p>
<p id="6"><span>⑥</span> Note on 180107: Now, suppose that the reason the girls were reluctant to mention grades is because they don’t do well on studies themselves, then 496 would be justified to be high-profile about her grades, because she deserves it through her own efforts. So should I publicize my grades or not? Well, just don’t do it in such a explicit manner like 496, and don’t mention the specific number unless asked...</p>
<p id="7"><span>⑦</span> An important thing to note is that, although we were supposed to talk about our growth, the classmates after me talked much about how they’re grateful to their roommates, classmates, or parents. That’s what I have not thought about. Their speeches are quite different than the jokey conversations we usually have, and I kinda experienced the other, true side of many of my classmates. Many of them have really high EQ!</p>
<p id="8"><span>⑧</span> Then, the 14 parents talked about their thoughts and expectations on us one by one. At the dinner, we took turns to toast our parents and our classmates. After the dinner ends, the parents sent their children a lamp respectively.</p>
<p id="9"><span>⑨</span> On 12/31 the family of 5 went back to Zhenjiang to attend my grandparents’ 80th birthday celebration, and Mom praises me for beginning to care for my grandparents.</p>
<p id="10"><span>⑩</span> (word count for 2017 Diary: 71659 words)</p>
