12`Back to ELR: On 5/11 I updated the Readme file of Manim.js and added instructions for how to use my code to create visualization, hoping it could attract more users.
31`Publicizing Manim.js and my videos hasn’t been easy for me; I looked at Quora and Stack Overflow, but these are basically Q&A websites and, in the end, I could only post on Reddit.
22`After reading about how Philip Guo “begged” others to try his IncPy in his early developmental process, I know that comparatively it’d be a lot easier to promote my project, as long as I try. I haven’t contacted Daniel Shiffman yet, and I’ll put this onto my agenda.
23`I finished PG’s book, the PhD Grind, from 5/13 to 5/17, and am now rereading it for the second time. I found it when writing D5P211; it’s very well-written and I find a ton of resonance: his reflections on his productivity across time, his project building experience (compared to my Manim.js), etc.
13`He even mentioned how studying hard is like training for Ironman Trilathon—using almost the exact same analogy as I did back in D5P117-180130:
<em>
“This process is like training yourself to run: every time, you push yourself so much that after you ﬁnish running, you’re exhausted. Although you lose strength in the short term, you become stronger in the long term.”
</em>
23`Of course, I also learned a ton about the CS research process. I also learned a number of expressions that can describe my state during this February: distraught, jaded, burned-out, demoralizing.
13`The difficult times of last semester is still lingering in my head and affecting my life attitudes. Compared to all those obscure concepts I needed to learn, solving Leetcode problems is easy. Doing life path research and networking is extremely easy, as easy as reading English novels back in 2016 summer. My motivation even increases, instead of exhausts, from doing these tasks.
23`And the sublimation of my study system inspired me on how to hone any skill as well. It took me two months of frustration before I sorted everything out. Next semester I will probably need to practice the ability to be “shameless” (bu yao lian), which is quite a different ability, but the process of training that ability is similar.
11`On 5/20 I started my summer research, and struggled to get Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook working properly. Although 491 asks me to get these setup stuff done as soon as possible, I resist keeping doing research after going home.
14`They do have a lot of work to do, which makes me question whether I’ll still be motivated to spend much time working with them (for free) next semester.
13`The pace of life seems to be similar to that of high school and quite different from college: I stay at a place where there is no bed for me to sleep for 8 ~ 9 hours a day, doing not so intense work. At night I need to finish extra “homework” for GRE and Leetcode.
14`I plan to allocate 100 hours for GRE, on average 2 hours every day from now. I also want to finish the wiki for Manim.js during my research, and eventually add it to the list of p5 addons, which I think will be a great way to promote my project.
11`On 5/21 I tried to learn how to use pandas to do data analysis, and it’s slow because I’m not at all familiar with it…
31`In the evening I visited 120’s apartment, which is way worse than 026’s Aertson apartment but also 2 times cheaper.
31`On 5/25 night I joined 120, 671, 619, 495, and another girl for hot pot, and we later played Script Kill and had a very good time together. We met again on 5/28. On 5/26 I moved from 026’s apartment to Kissam and 671 helped with me a bit since she also lives here. At night I had dinner with Francesca and Owuraku where I had no idea what they’re talking about throughout the meal (mostly their American friends).
34`When I first lived in Kissam, I didn’t sleep well for several days since the air conditioning wasn’t working properly. From 5/30 to 6/2 I’ve been sleepy all day and would often sleep 3 hours in the evening.
31`On 6/5 night I, 982, and 026 made dinner together. 026 made some curry dishes, and it was super delicious. Preparation was pretty time-consuming, though. 982 is also having a relatively easy time in his research, and told me that he definitely won’t stay at Vanderbilt next summer. On 6/6, 359 contacted me and asked me to do a presentation for underclassmen next Thursday.
