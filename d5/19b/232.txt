From 8/8 to 8/11 I, Dad and 697 went to Yancheng. On our way there, I and Dad had a very intellectual talk. I had a lot of fun chess games with 697. On 8/11 night, 906 invited me to attend the 4th match of the 2nd NFLS Alumni King Cup. On 8/12 I bought a pair of leather shoes; at night Dad got my beard shaved.
During my time with my family, my interpersonal awareness has increased amid their criticisms about my EQ, but my in-depth reflections on algorithms until 7/28 has been interrupted, and I no longer think about the problems I’ve done before I sleep, etc. Because of this, my shuati effectiveness has decreased a lot. The deep integration of knowledge can only be achieved when I’m completely alone.
On 8/16 I went back to NLC (Next Level Consulting) to retrieve my high school TOEFL account. I had a good talk with Julia about life at Vandy and the present situations of my peers.
I also met Bryan; I thanked him for his guidance 3 years ago, and complained about a lack of support for my job-seeking efforts right now. He recommended Cherry (D5P170) to me... As to NLC, after Bryan had a child and some of the teachers left, they only take 20 students every year now. Oh how lucky I was to join them!
Throughout my time in China, I always fall asleep within half an hour after going to bed, and never slept past 1 AM even when I sleep 1.5 hours in the late afternoon. (word count: 19236 words for the summer)
