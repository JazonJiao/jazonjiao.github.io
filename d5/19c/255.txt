31`On 10/27, 026 sent me a GRE word list while I studied with him. If I need to talk to 329, I just go to his dorm, and if I want to talk to 026, I just go to Stevenson.
12`I then made a Python program to help me recite GRE words (inspired by 133, who once made a Java program to help himself learn Spanish).
31`Recently the weather is less sunny, and when it rains, the scenery from my dorm windows becomes spectacular, both in the day and at nights. I love to see the distant mountains covered in fog—it’s magnificent! Although Towers is farther from campus, it’s worth it—the sights from my dorm is a significant depression repellant.
41`On 10/30~31, I and 495 struggled for the AI test together. We studied for 3 hours on 10/30; I showed her my GRE word-reciting software, and she recognized much more vocab than I do! 495 says that I don’t seem to care about the AI test, whereas she’s super stressed out. I replied that there was a time when I was also excessively worried about tests but now not anymore, and showed her D5P101-171207.
41`495 asked me tons and tons of questions; although some of the questions are a bit silly and slightly annoying, most of her incessant inquiries are insightful, and they greatly push me to understand the concepts more deeply as well. When I don’t know something, she’ll ask 474 instead, so as I begin to like her, I feel motivated to work hard so that she asks me more…
13`One drawback of 495’s inquiries is that she sometimes asks me about the solution when I haven’t looked at the solution yet. I, on the other hand, tend to let her infer what my questions are before asking them.

41`On 10/31, 495 received the job offer from GS. My mind was mostly blank from 17:00 to 18:00 (that hour felt so long to me). I thought about how I lost both a competitor and a great companion in my quest for grad school (actually, the only companion, since I’m not familiar with most other seniors), and about how our friendship might dissolve as she begins to enjoy life following her offer.
41`In spite of the offer, 495 mostly studied through the night; in fact, she’s calmed down and refocused on her homework by 17:30. 495 talked about how she suddenly begins to cherish school life as things will get complicated in the workforce. She says that in the next semester she’ll audit the deep learning and data science classes with me, and read a book every day. From my experience in early-mid September, I agree that having nothing to do is far more painful than leading a busy life.
21`Although the starting salary in the finance industry is similar to tech ($11k), growth is exponential once you get promoted. The downside is that the work is really tiring. As Philip Guo said, the banking industry doesn’t have much tolerance for mistakes, making the work highly intense.
