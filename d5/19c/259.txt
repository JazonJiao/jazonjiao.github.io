41`On 11/11, 495 was the only one who personally cheered me up for the GRE, after which I sent her a hearts for the first time. On 11/12 after the GRE test, I spent the rest of the day studying productively with her (from 14:00 to 23:00). The total time I spent studying with her (excluding our group projects with 468) has now reached 60 hours. I worked on my Crypto homework, while she worked on her 3670 (data science) homework (where I helped her out a bit since I was so familiar with the concepts).
41`When I was first with her, I didn’t feel super secure because of the previous separation: up to then we only studied for an hour in November. When preparing for the GRE, I was hesitant to study with 495 since I felt she can be no longer as concentrated as in October. But today she’s quite focused (well, her homework is due tomorrow), and by evening, I felt much more natural and was able to concentrate completely on my homework.
41`495 complained about the tediousness of various procedures and applications before she begins to work, and again “regrets” not going to grad school. She asked me to urge her to study next semester.
14`Without external pressure, it’s very easy to fall into “a state of limbo.” Even with 13 hours of courses, my work load is only at an average of less than 5 hours a day. Next semester when she only takes 1 course, how could she maintain the motivation to improve herself? Well, I’ll hopefully be studying with her a lot at the time. The issue here is what we should learn.
42`For many weeks, I’ve been immersed in the happiness brought by our intimacy, often without thinking deeply about how I can contribute to our friendship more. What are 495’s most prominent qualities? What does she like—food, movie genres, songs, places? What does she need the most?
41`495 called me a future lead of Google, and I wasn’t prepared to immediately respond. Only later did I praise her as a future vice president in GS. Of course, this is really hard to achieve; 495 says even getting promoted to “associate” is difficult and may take years.
41`Because the AI class is often pretty dull and low-paced, I’ve begun to dread this class. The 11/14 lecture was particularly boring, and with 495 sitting beside me, it seems that we both felt disinterested in the lecture but don’t know what else we could do, so it was pretty awkward.
11`By now the professor has covered almost all concepts in a typical AI class, but the concepts were often not explained adequately, and we can only rely on ourselves to figure out the concepts needed for the tests. The syllabus states that the course consists of 4 projects, but the professor canceled the 4th one, which is bad news to me as the projects are an extremely good way for me to get in touch with 495.
21`On 11/13, I did a quick mental survey of the Vandy seniors that I’m familiar with, as well as their life paths. Here’s a list of them:
21`459, Psychology; 464, seeking jobs; 466, grad school; 468, Quantum PhD; 469, CS PhD; 474, Quantum PhD; 475, indeterminate; 476, applying to CS MS programs; 477, Bio PhD; 478, Facebook; 480, Akuna Capital; 481 and 493, Microsoft; 483, grad school; 462, 488 and 492, Facebook; 490, finance MS; 495, needless to say.
21`There are also a lot of senior girls in the Numerical class whom I don’t know the names of, but they seem to all be primarily math majors and pursuing econ or finance paths. I now feel clearer about my abilities relative to other applicants; 476 seems to be my greatest competitor but also potential collaborator.
42`Also, after this mental survey I find that 495’s interests indeed match mine the most among the seniors… And I believe getting to know these seniors better can help with furthering my friendship with her as well.
