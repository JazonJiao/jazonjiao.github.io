D5P270-191210
33`I continued to search for how to tour Chengdu on 12/11 night. I looked at many tourist attractions, but many of them seem boring. The Guizhou trip (D5P231-190801) has taught me that popular sites are super crowded and will make me unhappy. I searched for musicals or cultural performances, but didn’t find any…
42`I still remember that on 9/28 night (D5P246), 495 talked about how she liked Aba. However, places like Leshan, 9zhaigou, and even Dujiangyan are just too far away from Chengdu for us to go.
43`I also sought help from 359 and 698, and 698 has offered a lot of interesting insights. Chasing a girl is such a great way to make friends with others!!
