41`I walked a total of 22.1 km (32,000+ steps) in Chengdu on 12/18, breaking the 16.8 km record set on 2018/8/16 (D5P153). 495 later complained that her back collapsed after such an intense day, while I didn’t feel too tired.
33`On 12/19, I toured Qingcheng Mountains and Dujiangyan. On 12/20 I toured the Panda Base alone, which is pretty well-organized (there aren’t many miscellaneous people selling things annoyingly). What I liked about the park was less about the pandas than about the fresh winter air in the beautiful bamboo forests.
41`Originally 495 mentioned touring the Pandas Base with me, but I saw on the internet that the park is so crowded that women’s bathrooms have 50-minute lines. This made me fear that this park is not suitable for dating. Turns out the park isn’t that bad.
43`When I talk to 139 about 12/18, he feels that this is really unreasonable. If I think about it, it all depends on how I view this. If I view her as a friend, then everything is okay.
42`I still have a lot of unanswered questions: why did I become her good friend while 468 didn’t? During our second group project, it appears that he shares a lot more common interests with her than I do (like Chinese singers); he also showed her his muscles.
43`After experiencing 293 and 495, I now believe it’s not necessary to be with (and especially chase) someone I like. My feelings for 293 in September were much stronger, but this brought about irrationality, reliance, loss of self, and intense emotional fluctuations.
43`While I took over a month to recover from the breakdown on 9/25, after the night of 12/18 my feelings are on average positive. If there are only week feelings between a cp, it might enable greater independence and maybe a healthier relationship. Well, maybe this is not a matter of feelings, but trust. I don’t know…
24`495 has so many good friends, but I often feel that by now people just don’t care about each other that much and it’s hard to maintain consistent friendship. I contacted 698 and 139 and tried to talk about my feelings, but both took a long time to reply to me.
41`After all these, it’s quite incredible that we only became good friends 3 months ago as I feel that a long time has passed; the GRE test was 5 weeks ago (11/12 was the last day I worked really hard) but it feels like half a year ago.
41`I and 495 talked for 69 consecutive days on WeChat, from 10/15 to 12/23. I don’t know when this record will ever be broken, and by whom...
