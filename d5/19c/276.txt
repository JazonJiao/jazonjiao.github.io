31`On my way to Shanghai, 329 told me he received Google’s interview and asked me to help him prepare. After arriving at Shanghai on 12/27 afternoon, 994’s parents held very deep talks with me. Uncle Wang discussed how he used AI/CS techniques to improve their education software.
12`Two main problems that he tackled: 1, predicting student performance based on past data; 2, make arrangements under constraints, for example putting 500 students into 10 classes with equal boy-girl proportion and average test scores, or devise class schedules under 10~20 constraints such as time availability of teachers.
24`He said few of his employees were capable of understanding his thoughts. Before the AI was implemented, he needed a lot of manpower to calculate course arrangements. Now, the efficiency increased a lot so he no longer fears that his employees leave.
13`I gained much more insights into how algorithm and math knowledge can be applied in the real world. Unlike in my summer research where I was doing pretty much meaningless things, the profit-oriented and client-oriented nature of industry applications make the results much more quantifiable. Of course, they can’t publish their methods. Mr. Wang said that image processing and NLP are the two most promising aspects of AI.
43`Aunt Kong taught me some principles of choosing my future wife. I emphasized the intelligence and aspiration of my ideal partner, while she said that I should keep in mind that I’m finding someone to live and raise children together for many years. I should keep an eye on the health conditions of the girl’s family and make sure they don’t have hereditary genetic issues.
43`She consoled me for failing 495 as of now, and said that Chinese girls in the US have severe disadvantages when choosing boys, which contradicts my own perception.
23`I comment that compared to them, Mom has relatively low EQ and lack social experience; on the other hand, Aunt Kong said that 994 blamed her for not being as smart academically as Mom, causing her to struggle on TOEFL and GMAT while I study with ease. Indeed, I and 994 are raised under parents with quite different personalities and social outlooks, resulting in our respective strengths and weaknesses.
31`Aunt Kong also discussed 994’s internships: how she impressed her superior with some simple gifts, how she actively sought out opportunities, etc. On 12/28, I talked to them again, but this time I learned much less. Uncle Wang talked about quantum computing and Buddhism.
31`On 12/30 night I returned to NFLS and later had dinner with 937, 907 (UIUC Mechy), 613 (who told us about CMU and other interesting news), 431 (transferred to UMich), 340 (RPI CS), and 806 (Wustl CS).
22`My application status for Stanford is somehow incomplete, and I figured that it’s because my transcript is unofficial, so on 12/31 I initiated a Certfile order. Hopefully it’s not too late.
