32`Our clock turned one hour forward on 11/3. Although my friends have complained that sky turns dark too soon now (16:45) and that the clock should be turned the other way around, I think the biggest problem is temperature. If the sun has just risen when we get up, then I’ll need to wear more for the morning than I do now, which creates problems since temperature can rise by 15 °C in the noon.
11`Course registration took place on 11/5. After some discussion with 495, I plan to take 3 CS classes with her, as well as two graduation requisites (Ethics and HCA). I spared up Fridays so that I can travel to places at weekends!
41`By now, 495 is disinterested in any intense courses. Despite her strong determination to enhance herself on 10/31, in just 5 days her attitude and actions have made a U-turn, and this has a noticeable impact on my life attitude as well—why not spend the next semester just chilling! Oh, how I look forward to that!
41`So my worry on 10/22 afternoon partially came true; as 495 begins to enjoy life and socialize, we now spend much less time studying together. However, I feel pretty secure since we have quite a few more assignments and tests coming for 3620 and AI.
41`I am no doubt her “datui” for Math 3620. She puts in limited effort for that class, and heavily relies on me to cram before the test. (On the other hand, though, she likes the AI class and shows more fastidiousness than me.)
13`How I wish I can also have a stable “datui” for other classes like Math 3320! 359 has become my greatest assistance for CS 3270, and maybe I should seek 983 for help for Crypto? For a long time, I’ve been mostly relying on myself in coursework like 982 does, and am not used to praising someone as dashen profusely. But for some classes it really saves a lot of time to have a datui, or just a friend to discuss…
41`Although I declared my intention to chase her on 10/22, as of now, it’s 495 who’s responsible for starting the vast majority of our interactions. But I need to put in a lot of effort as well; after all, when she contacts me to complain about something or to vent some feelings or to ask for help, I feel that it’s effortless on her side, while I often need to think hard about how to reply her.
41`From my experience, oftentimes she’s not comfortable at maintaining a conversation from the topics that I initiate, and my life is pretty uneventful recently (no interviews, etc.), so I don’t feel bad about her talking more than me.
41`I sometimes feel like 495 is literally treating me as her boyfriend now since she would often contact me or seek help from me over insignificant things.
42`But don’t overthink! Keep in mind that my connection with 495 is based on a lot of luck after all, so I shouldn’t expect too much. After all, I entered CS-3250 completely by accident last semester, and without it I wouldn’t be in AI class this semester.
41`One notable quality of 495 is that she always sits in an upright posture. I, on the other hand, am stooped while sitting, since most tables are not tall enough for me.
21`On 11/5 ckr received a Microsoft offer. When I met her, she says that Microsoft basically “sent this offer to her;” the interview questions are “verify BST” and “reverse linked list.” My first reaction was agreeing with her own words; however, 495 told me that her performance in CS 2201 was quite impressive when she TA-ed her, so I turned out to have underestimated her.
21`Is the claim that girls have an unfair gender advantage true? I don’t know. When I discussed 487’s Google offer with 983, she sort of agreed that luck played an important role, as the interviewers were all Chinese, and when 983 worked with 487 on group projects, 983 didn’t think her abilities to be superior.
21`I once complained to 979 that 495 only got the job offer because of the opportunities provided by GHC. I later regretted saying this, since there are likely more hidden talents of 495 that I haven’t discovered, and it’d be important for me to find them out.
42`On 11/10, while studying with 026 and 359, I made a comment that implied to 026 and 359 that I and 495 have the potential, so now 3 people know about this matter (on my side). (I first told 120 about it on 11/9.)
