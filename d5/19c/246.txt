41`On 9/28 night, 495 borrowed my notebook for Math 3670, and invited me to study with her, where I helped her out with her Math 3670 exercises; we eventually spent 2 hours together, and our conversation gradually got personal for the first time!
12`(BTW, apart from 3670, I’ve been helping people with CS 1101, 2201, 3250, 3251 as well… this takes up much of my time, but I can’t refuse them…)
41`When we departed at 9/29 0:50, I learned that 495 is now single. Ah! In the last week, our talk frequency is actually very high, although I didn’t think this was something special… as mentioned before, I and 495’s life goals, interests, and abilities highly overlap, so I’ll have to try!
31`Also, in the last 1 month I’ve been spending significant time (~30 min each day) watching CatLive videos on Bilibili, and the girl host (3cat) is from Chengdu, with a similar accent to 495’s, so I feel like I talk more like a Chengdu person now…
21`On 10/1, I studied with 469 for a night. 469 is attending 6 on-site interviews in this semester, so she has to fly to California frequently and miss on average 1 ~ 2 days of classes every week! I also smoked her e-cigarette (and choked when first tried…) she says she uses it occasionally to keep her awake.
21`From 10/2 to 10/4, 495 attended Grace Hopper at Orlando. She doesn’t like SWE positions and instead applied to data scientists at big techs, although this is really hard without a MS or PhD. Despite the low odds of job applications, she got a lot of fee waivers for grad school application, which can sum up to $1,000!! Ah!
41`By 10/8, 495 still frequently messages me and ask me questions; when I help her out, we can talk for a pretty long time. When I ask her for help, though, she most likely doesn’t know and our talk ends quickly, so things get a little awkward. Combined with the fact that we still seldom talk about non-academic stuff, these scenarios sort of reminds me of my conversations with 979 (D5P192)…
43`On 10/8, I saw 139 making a video call with his girlfriend, during which they just waved at each other incessantly without saying much. This is kind of funny, but I can feel how uplifting it can be to one’s psychology. In the long journey of PhD, should I seek for such kind of “boring” but super supportive relationship, or a more comradeship-based companionship where we fight on the same front?
43`In the 1.5 months since I declared that I stopped liking 493, I lost a powerful source of motivation, and my self-control decreased a lot. Back when I still liked her, setting her as my goal provided a concrete, consistent source of motivation for me. Now, however, I find myself wandering on the internet every day.
