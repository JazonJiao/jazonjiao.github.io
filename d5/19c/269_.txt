41`On 12/8 night, 495 invited me to study with her for 4 hours—adding up to 74 hours total, and that’s 2.6% of the 2,800 hours in this semester! She just copied my Math 3620 formula sheet and had a ton of things she doesn’t understand, so I guided her through all the concepts in great detail. This is the first time we met since 12/3, although we talk for at least half an hour on WeChat every day.
41`495 said that her father would like to have dinner with me in Chengdu. When I said that I’d love to meet him as well, she replied that “I won’t let you, unless you become my boyfriend.” I didn’t respond since it’s not yet time to make things clear, but was super happy that she’s well aware of everything—by now, it’d be really unreasonable if we don’t get together by this winter!
41`Although I can talk nonstop when explaining concepts to her, I’m not super good at talking about life incessantly. 495 did most of the job talking about other stuff: the classes she takes, the funny things 483 did in the 3670 study group, the food at Local Java, her contact lenses, our flights back home… 495 wonders where we could eat in Chengdu, and how I want to play.
41`Apart from regularly praising me as xueba, tonight, 495 complimented on my handwriting, as well as my personality: “Pisces have such good temper, and they are so considerate!” (I brought the previous tests with me, and when we departed, I asked her if she needs my color pens.) Back in 11/18, 698 once commented that Pisces and Cancer make a good fit; 495 comments that she as Cancer has a hot temper. Why do they care so much about zodiac signs…?
41`Because we talk so frequently, I’ve added a lot of new emoji packages to my collection to diversify my emotions. As 495 provides more-than-enough emotional support for me, my lifestyle also changes, as my reliance on other support methods decreased drastically, such as reminiscing home or places I traveled to.
24`Also, the proportion of my social life with boys with respect to girls increased a lot. In the first half of the semester, I enthusiastically helped several xuemei with their CS course questions. Since mid-November, few of them have contacted me, and I would have been less enthusiastic.
