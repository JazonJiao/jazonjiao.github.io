42`I arrived at Shanghai on 12/14 night. I got up at 3:00 on 12/15 morning, so while staying a hotel near Shanghai Station, I decided on the plan for my Chengdu tour: tour pandas base and Jinli on 12/18; climb Qingcheng Mts on 12/19; buy a book where the two of us will read together for winter at Fangsuo, and study in Sichuan library on 12/20. Also, maybe watch a Sichuan opera show on 18 or 19 night. I will hand her the love letter after the tour on 12/18 ends, and if she agrees, I can change plans and ask her to tour Happy Valley with me on 12/19.
41`On 12/15 afternoon, 495 changed plans twice, first saying she’s no longer free on 12/19 afternoon, and then 12/19 morning is also gone; she’ll make it up by playing with me on 12/17 and 18 nights, and we decided on where to eat for 12/17 dinner.
Although if I think about it, the time she will spend with me doesn’t decrease a lot, I still felt pretty mad because the plan that I spent several hours devising is now severely disrupted, while she showed no signs of apology, instead saying that she’s always busy in breaks, which sounds pretty arrogant to me.
22`Also, side note, my feelings were made worse as Dr. Roth haven’t submitted all 4 of my 12/15 letters even by 12/16 morning (12/15 afternoon CST). I had no choice but to buy a VPN and send him an email with all capitalized “urgent” to desperately remind him.
42`On 12/17, after getting up at 3:00, I took some time to write the formal version of my love letter. As with D5P181-181217, I first wrote draft in English on the phone, and then wrote a draft in Chinese on paper (finished 12/16 morning), before writing the final version.
42`My handwriting wasn’t good because I didn’t use a good pen until starting the 4th paragraph. After finishing, I disliked the first paragraph, so I rewrote it. At last, I folded an envelope and completed everything by 5:45. I plan to hand her the letter after the tour ends on 12/17 night.
43`Mom asked me to send 495 brocade as a gift, but I think it’s too expensive and won’t do any good. It’d be much more natural, pure, and sincere to just hand her my love letter.
Since I love railway, I took a high speed train from Nanjing to Chengdu. During the 10-hour, 2,000-kilometer trip across various tunnels and bridges, I was consistently astonished by how the diligent Chinese workers made this incredible feat.
41`After arriving at Chengdu on 12/17 evening, I underestimated the time it would take for 495 to get to the restaurant; I told her to set out at 18:15, but she arrived at 19:00 due to traffic, while I arrived 15 minutes earlier. 495 finally put on a nice outfit, with a white coat and high heels. I, on the other hand, wore the cool yellow coat bought in Miami, and wore jeans for the first time in my life.
41`Her father reserved an outdoors seat for us, and it was super romantic. Used to the dull campus life, I was so shocked by the luxury of our seat that my eyes were wide open in awe for the first ten minutes.
33`The meat and noodles I ordered were spicy, especially when I get to the bottom of the bowl. I felt my stomach was burning, and she commented that I’m vulnerable to Sichuan cuisine…
41`495 didn’t eat and just drank a little bit of juice. I didn’t mind ordering rather expensive food, since I thought ordering too little is disrespecting her father.
41`We later toured Fangsuo bookstore, since there wasn’t much else interesting to do in a commercial street full of clothing stores and restaurants. It’s much easier to talk when there are a lot of books present.
I talked about the role of Sichuan (then known as Ba) during the Chu-Han contention; 495 liked Chinese history when she was young, but then read a lot of literature (including novels in English). 495 also likes astronomy—my favorite subject, and almost chose it as her major!
41`We also encountered 493’s profile picture (the black cat), and I further exposed my story with 493: how we don’t have anything to talk about and she doesn’t talk about herself if I don’t ask, etc.
41`I still stumbled somewhat when I talk, and there are times when we run out of topics. We could have stayed for longer, but Fangsuo and many other stores close at 22:00, so we left. When we departed at 22:00, I said to her, I have a surprise for you. She said, food? I said, no no no, a letter. She said, okay, I’ll take it… I didn’t feel too nervous after going back to the hotel. Maybe I’m not nervous because I think I did the best I could so I have nothing to regret.
