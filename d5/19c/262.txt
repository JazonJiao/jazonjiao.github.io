41`On 11/24, I and 495 gathered again and studied for 7 hours (14:00 to 21:20). Again, in general we both achieved better efficiency than studying alone. I tackled 3 problems in AI project 3, and then helped her out.
41`The night before, I prepared some two-player games on iPad, but they turn out pretty boring, and I only managed to play two of them with 495. She tried to play Paopaotang with me, but I didn’t know how to play, so that didn’t turn out either.
41`Apart from that, our talk is still mostly academic-based. I introduced her to 492 and 480, while she commented that more than a dozen people from my grade (class of 2021) have big intern offers. We then endorsed each other for several skills. She then talked about the research she’s doing at Owen (it’s not econ! It’s business): analyzing user data, which is related to operations research. 495 says she regrets not going for a PhD…
43`What aspect of myself do I want to improve, and what value can I provide to her?
41`On 11/27, I chatted with 495 using Snapchat while at the beach; this is the first time I messaged someone using Snapchat, and I found that the photo and chat history are soon deleted… still, Snapchat might open up another way for us to communicate outside of WeChat messaging and texting.
41`Also, she’s the only one I’m following on Instagram (apart from 982). On 11/28, I realized that video posts on Ins are deleted in 24 hours?! I don’t like this style of transient social life, but 982 says that this is the trend nowadays.
41`I’m glad that apart from my (now) private Diary, there’s another person who I can share my academic ideas with. Although she thanks me less and less when asking me questions, I always reply patiently, and she pays me back by updating her worries about job logistics and sharing the life paths of her friends.
41`On 11/29, 495 commented that she survived the semester with the help of me, and indeed, throughout the semester I’ve indeed tried to help her for maybe over a hundred times for various things (no exaggeration), whenever she asks for it.
